The Checklist Manifesto, Atul Gawande, 978-0312430009, Nicholas Fethers, Senior Information Analyst at NHS Lothian,"It's basically a sell on how to design checklists that other people will use, making sure they're 100% completing tasks and documenting that they're doing them properly. It's an easy read, the writer is a surgeon so there's some medical examples of applications which is fun. Was definitely valuable while I was in research, some folk might find it interesting."
Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Yuval Noah Harari, , Ebrahim Ghaderi, a healthcare scientist at Public Health Scotland, "This is a twin recommendation for two books by Yuval Noah Harari, titled 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind' and 'Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,' are essential reading for healthcare personnel, as we can provide clearer insights into humanity, human behavior, interpretation of habits and the physical and mental health of community."
"The End of Alchemy: Money, Banking and the Future of the Global Economy", Mervyn King, , Colin Smith, an information analyst at NHS GGC, "A very interesting book from 2016.  Not medical but given we've another potential round of 'austerity' on the way, still relevant as to how we run the economy and fund the NHS and public services."
The Devil You Know - Encounters in Forensic Psychiatry, Gwen Adshead, , Louise Stuart, Health and Work Adviser at Public Health Scotland, "I used to work as an OT in a low secure forensic mental health hospital so it was nostalgic to revisit my time on the wards through this book. The author offers a compassionate insight into those who are accessing forensic mental health services with each chapter focusing on a different patients story and journey. I found this book to be a powerful and thoughtful read, and I would thoroughly reccommend."
Technofeudalism, Yaris Varoufakis, , Rita Nogueira, a Senior Information Analyst at NHS Lothian, "Together with the older book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zubroff. Thinking about how data and the technological companies are shaping the world around us economically and politically is important. Even if you don't agree with everything Varoufakis says it is an interesting  perspective that bears consideration."
Never Split The Difference, , , Brian Orpin, Project Office Team Manager at Public Health Scotland,  "Great book"
