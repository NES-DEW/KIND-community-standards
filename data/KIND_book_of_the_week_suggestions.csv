A Practical Handbook for Public Service Organisations,Sarah Morton and Ailsa Cook,9781447361930,Vasudha Singh,Improvement Advisor at NHS Lothian,We are trying to move towards outcome map based evaluation of projects.

Clean Code,Robert Cecil Martin,9780136083238,"Trendell, Zena",Programme Manager at NHS Lothian,I recently read *The Clean Code* by Robert Cecil Martin - I'm not a coder but thought it was very good. The book is about professionalism for developers (similar to accountants etc.) and give you some tools to help prevent feeling under pressure re: timescales.  It's not a recent book yet very relevant to some incidents that have happened lately
Asking the right questions: a guide to critical thinking,M. Neil Browne and Stuart M. Keeley,9780132203043,Alupha Chan,Research IT Facilitator at NHS Tayside,"think this will go well with this (mine is the 7th ed. which is linked here, I think it is up to the ?12th ed. now), which used to be a mandatory reading for my Communications (PR) dip. nearly 2 decades ago - one of the chapters is dedicated in looking at whether presented stats are deceptive:"
The 7 Deadly Sins of Psychology,Chris Chambers,9780691192277,Rosalyn Pearson,Senior Information Analyst at Public Health Scotland,"Highly recommend ""The 7 Deadly Sins of Psychology"" by Chris Chambers. All about pitfalls in real-world scientific methodology and what we can do to combat them. The title says ""psychology"" but it applies more broadly."
Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, , Liz Elliott, Senior Analyst at NHS Education for Scotland, "Very popular bestselling book that discusses cognitive biases and why humans are generally bad at assessing risk and interpreting statistics. Some of the research [cited in the book was found to be unsound](https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/) and Kahneman himself said ['I placed too much faith in underpowered studies'](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/20/placed-much-faith-underpowered-studies-nobel-prize-winner-admits-mistakes/).  [Its an interesting read](https://quality1supplements.com/daniel-kahneman-was-sometimes-wrong-and-always-right/), particularly with that in mind."
