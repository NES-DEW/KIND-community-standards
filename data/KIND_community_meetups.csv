What does their working day look like, how did they become data analysts, and what do (and don't) colleagues understand about their work. What's an unofficial analyst? It's a term we made up to describe people who do serious KIND-ish work without it really being an official or formal part of their job description. We're thinking here of managers who've had to turn themselves into data people to get the job done, clinical staff where the knowledge or data work has crept up to be an important part of their role, or researchers where finding the answers has started to involve much more technical digging (and technical skills) than initially thought.",1
