It comes from a request by Richard Hassett, who writes: I have fairly recently been gifted the task of running some (previously built) R scripting to produce medication adherence visualisations for a number of secondary care consultants working in my health board (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde). It aims to support easy identification of sub-optimal medication adherence and trigger a conversation between clinician and patient. It starts with raw data output from the Scottish Prescribing Information System (PIS), does some stitching and cleaning, uses custom functions to map dosage directions to a numerical equivalent, then gets fed through the R package Adhere-R (GitHub - ddediu/AdhereR: Computation of adherence to medications from Electronic Healthcare Data in R). It’s clever stuff and somewhat over my head to be honest. I have dabbled a bit in R but would still consider myself something of a novice. Soooo…my ask…firstly, I’d like some help to better understand what it is doing – I can’t often run it all the way through without some kind of error occurring. Through a process of trial and error I can usually resolve but I’m concerned I’m messing things up in the background. Secondly, it seems rather complex and so I wonder if there is scope to simplify or automate more of it…"
