<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="book-of-the-week">Book of the week</h2>
<p>John Carreyrou. 2018. <em>Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</em>. ISBN 9781524731656, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1030992480">Worldcat link</a>. A love-letter to the power of domain knowledge. Theranos was big-business - a tech startup offering near-instant blood testing for nearly anything at the bedside (or clinic, or shop, or‚Ä¶) with remarkable precision. Investors, including the media tycoons, politicians, and other tech leaders, believed this would be tranformative - indeed, highest praise, disruptive. Yet laboratory medicine experts were absolutely convinced that the technology glibly described here as ‚Äúnear market‚Äù was an illusion. Want to guess who was right?</p>
