## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to the regular KIND network update. Again, lots of training sessions underway this week. Please see [our training mini-site](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/) for full details and resources.

Hope to see you at something soon

Brendan

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:

+ Applied for a promoted post and have been selected for interview - even if I am not the successful candidate - applying for a new role is way outside my comfort zone, so being shortlisted feels like a huge win.
+ I received good feedback from a senior manager on a dashboard I worked hard on.
+ Led a session on measurement and developing measurement plans and it was well received! Fells like a big win :-) 
+ Managed to fix number and percentage formats on a monthly spreadsheet following learning at this weeks Excel session, straight forward when you know how it works :)

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.

+ we're running our R beginner's club next week 3-4pm, Thursday 13th Feb. That's some social time for beginners to review their code, get unstuck, and pick up some tips and tricks. Please follow [this link to join us](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1725260923641?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d).
