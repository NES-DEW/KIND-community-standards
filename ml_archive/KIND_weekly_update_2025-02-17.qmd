## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to the regular KIND network update. We've got two community meetup sessions running this week, so look forward to seeing you at one or other of them.

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:

+ After slight procrastination, I started on our new intranet page and it's almost completed, It's looking quite good although I say so myself
+ Took part in my first KIND training session on Power BI
+ Got several tricky reports finished (or at least off my desk for the moment). In non-work related things, successful soup-making experiments. (The curried butternut squash, sweet potato and lentil was particularly nice.)
+ I shared an idea I have had for a while that colleagues have responded well too and its gaining traction

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.

+ we're running our R beginner's club next week 3-4pm, Thursday 13th Feb. That's some social time for beginners to review their code, get unstuck, and pick up some tips and tricks.
