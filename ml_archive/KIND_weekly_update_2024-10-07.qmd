## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to our regular KIND network update. I'm away for the second half of October, which will necessitate a brief pause for our training and community events. We'll be back in late October, and you can expect the next regular email update in early November. Hope to see you at something then.

Brendan

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:

+ I owned a work mistake and the world did not explode
+ Using a chi-square test of independence on a dataset (when I wasn't asked to) and the requestor actually understanding and really liking the outputs
+ I pushed against my introvert preference and held a training session to help staff understand the relationship between DATIX incidents, the boards risk strategy and H&S actions
+ I have managed to build a small shiny app. Although I have a long way to go. I am feeling really proud
