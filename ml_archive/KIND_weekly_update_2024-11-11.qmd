## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to our regular KIND network update. We've got a few R-themed events coming up this week, including our regular monthly R beginners club session. Hope to see you there if you're curious about R, a new R starter, or trying to build your R skills. 

Brendan

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:

+ Felt like I was plodding along this week, but looking back I've managed to get a couple of large pieces of work completed and am organised for next week so a success!
+ Been asked to go along to a group run by a colleague, to support some work they're doing and bring a different viewpoint. Chuffed at being asked and that my opinion is valued in a non-threatening but supportive way
+ I won an americano tournament in paddle ðŸŽŠ
+ Finally managed to complete and submit the practical component of my GA coursework assignment.

More experienced R programmers are absolutely welcome too, but this session is focused on those new to (or returning to) R code. All welcome, especially if you're brand new to R or are coming from our R from Scratch course. "))
