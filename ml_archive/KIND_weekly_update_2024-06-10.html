<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Welcome to our regular KIND network update. Full details of our events and training can be found <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&amp;tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a">on our Teams channel</a>. This is a comparatively quiet week for one-off training sessions, but Iâ€™m pleased to say that weâ€™ll be re-running our pivot table introduction, and hope that we wonâ€™t have the same number of technical problems as the last time. Iâ€™m also excited to launch our new R beginnerâ€™s club. This is a space dedicated to supporting those new to R, and giving them space to develop their skills.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at something soon</p>
<p>Brendan</p>

<section id="book-of-the-week" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="book-of-the-week">Book of the week</h2>
<p>Andrew Brown. 2004. <em>In the beginning was the worm : finding the secrets of life in a tiny hermaphrodite</em>. ISBN 9780743415989, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/53388833">Worldcat link</a>. Itâ€™s now close to twenty years old, and deals with the research uses of a microscopic nematode worm, but this short and interesting book remains one of the most compelling introductions to health research out there. For analysts, the story here is one of wrangling. Not the usual wrangling and tidying data to permit analysis that weâ€™re so used to, but a very similar process of wrangling the properties of an organism (<em>C. elegans</em>) to make it behave. Bonus points for the comments about the <a href="http://wbg.wormbook.org/">Worm Breederâ€™s Gazette</a> which remains a favourite niche technical publication.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re launching our first community standards document today. Written by the community, these describe sensible minimum standards for the projects and documents that KIND members typically work on. We have begun this process with (of course) a set of <a href="https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-community-standards/Excel%20-%20KIND%20Community%20Standards">KIND Excel standards</a>, and we will begin drafting a complementary description for R-based work next week. Please contribute if you can!</p>
<!-- Our [Power BI](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/70921) and [Excel](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/71690) training courses are now full, but a great video alternative has been suggested as the resource of the week by Martin Scott (Aberdeenshire Council). This [Hands-On Power BI (video) Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77jIzgvCIYY) covers similar ground to our intro course, and has the advantage of using open (US) data to demonstrate core concepts. -->
<!-- We have a very few spots left on our [intro to R and Rmarkdown](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/62249), [Shiny](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/67960), and [intro to evidence-based medicine/critical appraisal](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/75780) courses too, so please feel encouraged to sign-up via TURAS if you're interested. -->
