Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to our regular KIND network update. I'm delighted to say that our R reading group will be back next week on Thursday 26th 3-4pm. You can find [details and the link to the reading on our the community pages](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-community-standards/rreadgr.html).

This past week has also thrown up a few technical hitches in training sessions. The most common cause of trouble comes from guests joining our training sessions without belonging to the KIND Teams channel. We love meeting new people in training, and I'm always grateful for the word of mouth transmission that helps so many of our activities reach people right across the sector. So please can I encourage you to pass on the [link to join the channel](https://forms.office.com/r/WQdd6HSCEW) to anyone who might be interested in our sessions and materials. Thanks - it'll help make everything smoother for everyone.

Hope to see you at something soon

Brendan

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:

+ Carried out an audit following the correction of some data, presented it at a meeting and was given the go-ahead for my suggested fixes, and implemented them! Yay!
+ I did a Couch to 5k session this morning before work this morning. Tiring but felt good after!
+ A teeny victory but a victory nonetheless - whole load of Committee papers collated and converted as necessary, sent for checking before issue to all; and there were no changes required!  Go me!
+ Just made some colleagues' day by introducing them to pivot tables and charts to report their data.  Best part of my job is the sounds that emanate from learners when they're amazed.  It never gets old...
