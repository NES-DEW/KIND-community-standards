## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

I'm pleased to announce that we've now got the beginnings of a schedule for Power Automate week, which can be found below. I'd also like to announce another week of dates to save:

**Save another date** - data literacy week, 14th April to 17th April 2025. That'll be (almost) a week dedicated to sessions about core data skills and knowledge. More information on that over the coming weeks.

Brendan

### Support group

### Project presentations

Presentations from members of the network. There are more to come of these, and please get in touch if you'd like to show your Power Automate work - it definitely doesn't need to be elaborate or fancy to be important and interesting.

+ [Pauline Russell (NSS) - customer supply notification process using Excel, and potentially something else...](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/8b6622f1-7bd1-4523-bc99-1f9dcc140c00@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a), Thursday 3rd April 10.00-11.00

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:

+ Discovered the Spreadsheet Compare Tool which was a revelation!
+ A Friday win - combining multiple Excel Worksheets into a single worksheet with Power Query. I did need a YouTube video to set me on the right path though :)
+ Getting to grips with my job role after a period of illness. Although i know I should do this, I have to remind myself to take breaks. I even put an alarm on!
+ Despite being a ridiculously busy week and getting pulled in a million different directions, I've somehow managed to keep on top of everything, and gotten so much done! (had a minor goof today though, been rushing to get work done before a meeting "this afternoon," but uh... turns out it's next week ðŸ¤£ (so relieved for the extra week, not gonna lie!))

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.
