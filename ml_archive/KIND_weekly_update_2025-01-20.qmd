## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to our regular weekly update. Last week we launched a new puzzle of the week segment, with a simple-ish technical puzzle about extracting dates from text. Please keep an eye out for next week's challenge, which will be about recognising and standardising abbreviations.

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:

+ Managed to run a dashboard without activating a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" event
+ Been accepted to start a PGCert next week. All hail being a student again!
+ I completed a really complicated report using GIS as well as R syntax. Requester was very happy with the result.
+ Crafted some custom functions to solve the puzzle of the week every day

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.
