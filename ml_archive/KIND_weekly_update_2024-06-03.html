Forecasting: principles and practice, 3rd ed</a>, which deals with <strong>time series graphics</strong>. Lots of interest in our earlier discussions about forecasting, and this chapter looks like a gentle way into understanding some of the R code (and the theory) needed to do that. Weâ€™re also looking for a willing volunteer to lead the session too - you donâ€™t need to do lots of preparation for that, but instead just be familiar with the chapter and have picked out some areas that you think are interesting. Please get in touch if youâ€™re keen.</li>

<section id="book-of-the-week" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="book-of-the-week">Book of the week</h2>
<p>Ludwig Fleck (Bradley and Trenn, trans.). 1979 (1935). <em>Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact</em>. ISBN 9780226253252, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/14283058">Worldcat link</a>. If last weekâ€™s book was a paean to the use of scientific facts, this weekâ€™s book tells a rather more subtle story about how facts. It starts by telling the story of the â€˜discoveryâ€™ of the Wassermann reaction, and uses that history as the basis for an investigation of the ways in which people came to a) claim that the Wassermann reaction worked because of scientific facts and b) how those facts changes as the Wassermann reaction became used in practice.</p>
<p>From the KIND-ish stance much of the interest lies in the parts of this book that describe how medical research wasnâ€™t the straightforwardly objective story about discovery that we often want to portray. Fleckâ€™s claim, broadly, is that the Wassermann reaction was invented, rather than discovered, and that invention reflected (in part) the social organisation of researchers and others involved in its discovery. Of particular interest to people like us are a series of claims about how facts change as they travel out from the specialist communities that work on them. Weâ€™re all familiar with the changes that happen (and need to happen) as we pass the results of our work out to their eventual users: they often get simplified, or put in context, or whatever.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resource-of-the-week">Resource of the week</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/70921">Power BI</a> and <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/71690">Excel</a> training courses are now full, but a great video alternative has been suggested as the resource of the week by Martin Scott (Aberdeenshire Council). This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77jIzgvCIYY">Hands-On Power BI (video) Tutorial</a> covers similar ground to our intro course, and has the advantage of using open (US) data to demonstrate core concepts.</p>
<p>We have a very few spots left on our <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/62249">intro to R and Rmarkdown</a>, <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/67960">Shiny</a>, and <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/75780">intro to evidence-based medicine/critical appraisal</a> courses too, so please feel encouraged to sign-up via TURAS if youâ€™re interested.</p>
