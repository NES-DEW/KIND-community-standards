## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to an extremely windy KIND network update. Hope you're keeping safe.

A retrospective notice of an interesting resource: the Knowledge Network produced an excellent [Sway full of resources for health information week](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/BHZrCylRdpJFHVpX?ref=Link). Highly recommended.

We've also got the first of our 2025 run of community meetup sessions happening next week. That's kindly been offered by Richard Hassett, a specialist senior prescribing support technician from NHS GGC. He writes:

> I have fairly recently been gifted the task of running some R scripting to produce medication adherence visualisations for a number of secondary care consultants working in my health board. It aims to support easy identification of sub-optimal medication adherence and trigger a conversation between clinician and patient...I’d like some help to better understand what it is doing. Through a process of trial and error I can usually resolve but I’m concerned I’m messing things up in the background. Secondly, it seems rather complex and so I wonder if there is scope to simplify or automate more of it...

This should be an excellent session for R-enthusiasts to come together to support an innovative and useful project. [Please consider coming along if you can](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/05a434c4-104c-4651-ace7-e2a17f03a028@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a) between 3.30-4.30 next Tuesday.

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:

+ I was awarded Level 2 Digital Champion!
+ Since successfully testing our first ever published PowerBI dashboard last week we've added another 4 this week, dramatically reducing the burden of work that would otherwise have gone into producing regular analysis packs.
+ Successfully implemented a change in work which included upscaling and altering project methods...without a single complaint from staff
+ I was asked to estimate how much data our dataset is missing(!) and was able to devise a methodology that has limited validity but can help to inform the impact it has had on our outputs.

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.
