## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to our regular KIND network update. We've had several requests for help with interview preparation over the past couple of weeks. That means that we're going to develop a couple of regular sessions designed to help people build and practice their skills as interviewees (and as interviewers) over the coming weeks. If you're looking with some trepidation at an interview task or similar, please get in touch and we'll try and arrange support for you.

A couple of miscellaneous reminders for you this week:

- We're still looking for volunteers to help lead some of the discussion sessions at the unconference on the 11th Dec. See the discussion on the [Unconference Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A841c83b753324873866f54b10b5ce380%40thread.tacv2/KIND%20Unconference%202024?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a) for more details.
- I've also put out a call for [training requests via this form](https://forms.office.com/e/zLaKHXvcBt) - please let me know what training sessions and courses you'd like to see during the first few months of 2025.

Hope to see you at something soon

Brendan

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A non-random selection of some of the firsts from this bumper clutch of wins:

+ Running my first sub 30 min 5k!
+ Running my first workshop!! Learned a lot...but got good feedback which was nice to hear :)
+ Created my first [funnel plot](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/funnel.html) in R
+ Bought my first Christmas jumper of this year... (I have a few) Not wearing them until 1st December, but then all systems are go! Also googled Lambda formulae and looking forward to demystifying the mathsspeak - I love a formula but I rarely know correct terminology for these things!
+ Got the team's first publication out. Hopefully many more to come!

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.
