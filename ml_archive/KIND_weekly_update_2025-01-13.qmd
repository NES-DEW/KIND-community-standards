[NHS England have recently produced a template file](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/brand-guidelines/nhsr-community/), and the plan for this week's community meetup is to spend an hour working together to develop one for Scotland. All welcome, especially non-expert and new R users, because this looks like a great starter project if you're looking for a first R project with a public component")

## Week beginning `r nice_date(next_week_start)`

Dear colleagues, 

Welcome to the first KIND weekly update of 2025. Lovely to be back, especially as we're just starting off an intensive period of training sessions over the next couple of months. More details on those below - and hope to see you at one of them soon. 

Brendan

## Wins of The Week
In the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. This can be a tough period for many, so the selection this week celebrates colleagues who have had a tricky time recently:

+ I put my hand up to say I'm struggling. Takes a lot for me to admit that I need help. but reminding myself that its not a sign of weakness. And the plus is that I was heard and supported. So going into the weekend feeling more positive.
+ Despite my brain's best efforts, I managed to be productive this week and did everything I was asked and promised to do.
+ Not really much of an achievement but I have survived the first full week back to work after the two short weeks of the festive period, and it's not been too bad!! Looking forward to the weekend though!
+ Started back into this project from before christmas that's been making me very anxious. I'm doing it!

Well done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.

## Training sessions

Please note that we've changed the way that our training events are set-up. You should now be able to click the session link to add yourself directly to the session. Also please note that the Excel first steps, BI for beginners, Introductory Shiny, and Tableau sessions are the first installment of multi-session courses. More information and session resources can be found [on our training pages](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/).
