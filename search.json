    "text": "How to think about joins?\nWe did a simple join above. A join is a way of merging two datasets. Let’s demonstrate with some cut-down datasets from above. We’ll remove some of the values from our b1 set and from our b2 set:\n\nb1 &lt;- b1 |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\nb1\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy  0.590\n2 victoria 0.248\n3 peter    0.644\n4 judi     0.887\n5 paul     0.336\n\n\n\nb2 &lt;- b2 |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\nb2\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name    score\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kenneth 0.393\n2 kennedy 0.590\n3 peter   0.644\n4 michael 0.561\n5 judi    0.887\n\n\nThe simplest join we could do is to bind the rows from one set onto another:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  bind_rows(b2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   name     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 kennedy  0.590\n 2 victoria 0.248\n 3 peter    0.644\n 4 judi     0.887\n 5 paul     0.336\n 6 kenneth  0.393\n 7 kennedy  0.590\n 8 peter    0.644\n 9 michael  0.561\n10 judi     0.887\n\n\nThat just brings all the rows from b2 onto the end of b1. Unlike binding, though, in a join we usually want to only include some of our values. So let’s now left-join b2:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  left_join(b2, by = \"name\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  name     score.x score.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy    0.590   0.590\n2 victoria   0.248  NA    \n3 peter      0.644   0.644\n4 judi       0.887   0.887\n5 paul       0.336  NA    \n\n\nYou should see that only the values from b2’s score column that have a corresponding name in b1 get populated, and everything else gets filled with NAs. Here’s a nice introduction to the different kinds of join you can do in dplyr."

It’s worth noting the VSTACK function, which allows you to bring one table into another in Excel. PowerQuery has some great tools for binding data. Append Queries allows you to perform row-binding:\n\n\n\nSelect Append Queries\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect datasets to bind together\n\n\n\n\n\nNew table containing all rows from the original\n\n\nHowever we bind, the main distinction remains the same.

And so we might be reassured that it’s not just us, that ‘all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day taken up in the filling out of forms.’ The most interesting parts of this book though are not about just moaning about the quantity of paperwork that we face, but instead point out exactly why all that paperwork might really be something to worry about. As the author notes, endless box ticking seems to prevent useful communication and other human interactions. Or, more cuttingly: ‘Bureaucratic procedures…make even the smartest people act like idiots’. That point then leads into a balancing act. As the title might suggest, some rules seem to constrain or prevent us doing useful things, while some rules seem to do the opposite (say, by insisting that we can’t discriminate based on appearance). So there’s a balancing act between different kinds of rules, that shows up as a long-running back and forth between different ways of ruling, that the author traces across times and places. That range of cases, and pleasure in talking about paperwork, is a substantial contributor to the great charm of the book..\nUnsubscribe from these emails"

All staff will have access to the online version of the app. You can find the app within the office application launcher (the waffle icon in the top left of the screen when using any office 365 applications on the web) (Figure 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: How to find Visio within the application launcher on 365 online.\n\n\n\nVisio can be employed for a variety of uses, such as:\n\nProcess mapping;\nFlowcharts;\nMatrices;\nVenn diagrams;\n‘Swim lane’ diagrams;\nStep plans such as communication plans.\n\nVisio has several set templates that can allow users to begin from a pre-designed example. This can enable users to quickly produce a clear, concise and professional looking diagram if they know the format they would like to present their information in."

    "text": "How to use Visio\n\nBlank template\nIf starting with a blank template, your workspace will be a clear page. Visio will provide a ‘shapes’ tab on the left side, with which you can begin clicking and dragging to populate the diagram.\nN.B. If you are doing traditional flowchart process mapping, certain shapes have certain meanings. For example, a circle usually denotes the start/end of a process, and a diamond denotes a decision (which will have branching YES or NO results). For more information, see Process Mapping Symbols in the appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The ‘blank template’ work screen of Visio\n\n\n\nOnce on the page, Shapes can:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: When right clicking on a shape, the options provided will allow you to change the size of the shape (a), appearance of the shape (b), or become a button via insert a link (c).\n\n\n\n\nChange size: Click on the shape and click + drag on the points that appear at its corners/edges to alter its dimensions (Figure 3, a)\nChange appearance: Right click on the shape, and use the ‘shape fill’/’shape outline’/’weight’ and ‘dash’ icons that appear in the window to edit the appearance of the shape (Figure 3, b)\nContain a link: The shapes can be edited to become buttons that will send viewers to a hyperlink when clicked. Right click on the shape, choose link from the window, and enter the URL that you would like the shape to direct to. ‘Add display text’ will show text that appears when viewers hover over the button, you can use this to provide a simplified link address or additional context (Figure 3, c)\nBe connected to other shapes: hover over the shape (without clicking) and green points will appear. If you click and drag from these points, Visio will generate an arrow that can be connected to another shape. Alternatively, some directional arrows will appear around the shape; if you hover over these; Visio will suggest new shapes that you can choose from, and it will auto-populate that shape connected to your original shape. (Figure 4)\n\nOther options are available to you on the Shapes panel on the left side of the workspace:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: If using the suggested arrows to generate shapes and connectors, hover over the arrows, choose the desired shape, and a new shape will be created connected via arrow to the original shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Basic shapes (a), more complicated arrows and connectors (b), stencil (c) (note this is a feature available only to a paid/upgraded Visio application and will not be available to staff by default), add shapes from other libraries/templates (d), and search for a shape by text (e). This is useful if looking for a specific shape to populate into your diagram, such as an email or document icon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking from pre-designed templates\nIf starting with a suggested template, your shapes panel on the left side will appear slightly different, to provide shapes that match the diagram intended. For example, if you are looking to create a Venn diagram, the shapes panel on the left will provide you with suggested overlapping shapes of 2-sets, 3-sets etc. Think (as a team if necessary), about what you are looking to produce before you begin and in what format this would look best/be most accessible/understandable, and choose the corresponding set template to get yourself started."

    "section": "Tips for getting the most out of Visio",
    "text": "Tips for getting the most out of Visio\n\nPlan out beforehand, either alone or with your team as appropriate, what format would work best for the information you are trying to provide. The same information can be provided in many different ways, and often one format will work better than another for the information you are trying to visualize. For example, a swim-lane diagram is better than a traditional process map when attempting to show responsibilities moving across different contributors/organisations.\nOnce you have a shape on the diagram that works well (has been sized, coloured and outlined in the manner that you want), you can copy and paste this shape instead of having to create it from scratch again. This helps massively with saving time, and helps generate a uniform formatting within the diagram.\nVisio’s workspace is reactive and will automatically grow if you exceed its borders. This is useful to know as it means you do not constantly have to move or re-shape your items to remain within the borders of the page. You may find it easier to generate all of the items for your diagram first, and move/locate/connect them all later on, once you have a feel for the amount of space your diagram requires.\nInclude a legend – provide a legend somewhere alongside the diagram, indicating what the different shapes, colours and connections mean (especially if the diagram becomes more complicated).\nIf it is difficult to fill in pieces of a process map because the information is poor or there is no information, don’t worry - this is also really useful information! Mapping out systems can identify gaps or weaknesses in the current process. Wherever this occurs, make a note of it, and when analysing the map with the team during review, explain the difficulties encountered to the team. This will prompt them to provide the missing information, and/or cause them to review the current process for quality improvement."

    "text": "Time to complete/resource allocation\nSimple Visio mapping can be quite quick, especially if using suggested template shapes to complete a task. However, complex diagrams can be quite tedious and time consuming to prepare.\nAs a result, any team member undertaking a complex process mapping task should be able to discuss with their line/work management how much time they can allocate to this, reasonable/realistic deadlines, and expectations alongside other work. If generating a visualisation like this is urgent, then the team member should be able to give priority over their other work to the task.\nProcess mapping is an excellent development opportunity as it is a flexible skill valuable to many different roles and teams. Anyone should be encouraged to try out using the tool where relevant to their work, or simply as a PDP exercise to familiarize themselves with the process."

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"

The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy. ISBN 9781612195186, Worldcat link.\n This is a fun and thought-provoking set of essays about bureacracy. It starts with a mystery: why, if people hate bureaucracy, is there so much of it?. A recurring theme in many KIND events that we spend lots of time managing forms and paperwork, rather than doing more important work. And so we might be reassured that it’s not just us, that ‘all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day taken up in the filling out of forms.’ The most interesting parts of this book though are not about just moaning about the quantity of paperwork that we face, but instead point out exactly why all that paperwork might really be something to worry about. As the author notes, endless box ticking seems to prevent useful communication and other human interactions. Or, more cuttingly: ‘Bureaucratic procedures…make even the smartest people act like idiots’. That point then leads into a balancing act. As the title might suggest, some rules seem to constrain or prevent us doing useful things, while some rules seem to do the opposite (say, by insisting that we can’t discriminate based on appearance). So there’s a balancing act between different kinds of rules, that shows up as a long-running back and forth between different ways of ruling, that the author traces across times and places. That range of cases, and pleasure in talking about paperwork, is a substantial contributor to the great charm of the book."

If you’ve ever wondered about how maps can be used to understand health and disease, this book gives a wide-ranging and engaging series of examples. It’s also (pretty unsurprisingly) packed with well-reproduced examples of unusual and historically-important maps that might provide some left-field food for thought if your work involves a geographical element. There are also lots of useful cross-connections made between disease mapping and other issues of health and care interest - tropical medicine, deprivation, and occupation especially."

This book looks across a series of ordinary activities to show how, a decade or so ago, algorithms were shaping our lives. While the tech may have moved on, the moral of the work remains: algorithms are capable of serious harms if they are designed and applied thoughtlessly. I’d make this compulsory reading for colleagues working with data if I could - not least because it’s a surprisingly engaging read given the serious subject-matter. The data that we work with can have all kinds of unpredictable destinations, and the potential scope of end-uses of that data should be considered when building tools that collect and combine powerful data. Again, it’s another reminder that data with enough power to effect positive change will often be usable to bring about harms."

In the training session, we ended up in an interesting conversation about the rate of change of facts in health. That rate of change (or, to jump ahead a bit, the rate of decay) of the facts was a surprise to some of us. So I wanted to highlight this useful book, which gives a lot of examples of changing facts. That’s accompanied by a useful discussion of the causes and consequences of changing facts - how they spread, how we get tripped up by them, and what we might do to deal more elegantly with knowledge that’s always a bit unstable."

As it came up during a training session this week, I wanted to mention one that I thought was particularly useful for people in the KIND workforce. Although originally written for medical students, this book is an excellent quick source of reliable knowledge about core statistical pricinples and techniques. I’m recommending an older edition - and there are lots of newer editions available too - partly because this older edition is much more concise than the later versions, but also because this edition is one of the very few books that I’ve used every week or so since I was a student, particularly for the statistical tables and test selection flowcharts. Highly recommended, many copies available in various libraries across Scotland, and some pleasing shock-of-the-old about data entry techniques from the late 1990s."

She writes: ‘The author discusses relatively new research that sees a strong interconnection between our interroception, our immune system, and emotions, showing how intertwined psychology and medicine are. She makes a strong case for the whole-system-approach, because isolated symptoms can easily be mislabelled by both practitioners and patients. The book also includes a critical perspective on the still prevalent methodology of studying emotions and mental illness.’ It’s an excellent book, and one that’s particularly refreshing in a field that’s dominated in the popular view by a series of works from the nineteenth century - the Bells, the Duchennes, and the Darwins especially."

This week’s book of the week is about thalidomide. Initially sold as an entirely safe sedative, suitable for use in pregnancy, the drug turned out to cause serious harms in utero. A spectacular increase in a previously-rare limb abnormality called phocomelia, even though a cause of widespread alarm amongst paediatricians, did not prevent the continued marketing of the drug. This book, which takes a long and cold look at this ‘disaster’, with particular attention to the greatly-enhanced safety research that became required for new medicines as a consequence. This change was in large part due to one of the great heroes of obstinancy, Frances O. Kelsey, and her tenacious work in demanding higher standards for FDA drug approvals. Also highly recommended is the short review of this book in Nature from a lost era when high-quality book reviews were still a priority for academic publishers."

One of our members, Andrew Saul from PHS, suggested an interesting example concerning the discovery of blood circulation, where some researchers appeared to try and cloud the waters in order to defend their own pet theory. That brings me to a first, which is a BotW recommendation that comes with a competing interest as it was written by a former colleague of mine. This excellent short account of Harvey’s work in the mid-seventeenth century, culminating in the publication of De Motu Cordis in 1628, takes us through the story of blood circulation, with some thoughtful discussions about the reasons why some researchers appear to us now so keen to mislead. De Motu Cordis was also the oldest book that I know of whose publication was managed to co-incide with the Frankfurt book fair, so that’s another interesting first for the week."

This book describes several agnotologies - cases where doubt (about the likely environmental impacts of pollution, say) - and then uses those cases to set up a thoughtful discussion about uncertainty and understanding. For us, who often work with data and evidence which might be at least somewhat open to interpretation, it’s an excellent reminder to think carefully about the interpretations that might be placed on our work. It’s not enough, as these cases clearly show, to try and let the data speak for itself - particularly when (in some cases) there are parties who seek advantage by muffling and confusing that speech."

Not the usual wrangling and tidying data to permit analysis that we’re so used to, but a very similar process of wrangling the properties of an organism (C. elegans) to make it behave. Bonus points for the comments about the Worm Breeder’s Gazette which remains a favourite niche technical publication."

ISBN 9780226253252, Worldcat link.\n If last week’s book was a paean to the use of scientific facts, this week’s book tells a rather more subtle story about how facts. It starts by telling the story of the ‘discovery’ of the Wassermann reaction, and uses that history as the basis for an investigation of the ways in which people came to a) claim that the Wassermann reaction worked because of scientific facts and b) how those facts changes as the Wassermann reaction became used in practice.  From the KIND-ish stance much of the interest lies in the parts of this book that describe how medical research wasn’t the straightforwardly objective story about discovery that we often want to portray. Fleck’s claim, broadly, is that the Wassermann reaction was invented, rather than discovered, and that invention reflected (in part) the social organisation of researchers and others involved in its discovery. Of particular interest to people like us are a series of claims about how facts change as they travel out from the specialist communities that work on them. We’re all familiar with the changes that happen (and need to happen) as we pass the results of our work out to their eventual users: they often get simplified, or put in context, or whatever."

Rest assured that the title of Gould’s The Mismeasure of Man is a pun: both on the idea that man is the measure of all things [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/protagoras/], and on precisely the kind of not-thinking that we discussed last time.  This is a book about the history of measuring intelligence, and why we might worry about collapsing all possible measures of intelligence to a single number, like IQ. That story is told through a diverting series of detailed historical reconstructions about methods used to measure intelligence and related human features. Lots of this is about measuring skulls, and if you’re into that sort of history of science, seeing the kinds of dispute that switching between lead shot and mustard seed as measures of brain volume might cause is worth the investment - not least because it has surprisingly contemporary connections to the anthropometrical work that still powers much of modern ergonomics, human factors, etc. But the real value for most of us who do KIND-ish work isn’t this rich historical detail, fun though it is. It is instead about the abstractions about complicated human activities that lie close to the surface of our work. Every time we report a figure that collapses a complex activity into a single value we should be careful - particularly when that abstraction might well be influenced by our existing beliefs and practices. might shape that collapse.”"

Most of those gaps are mainly accidental - we just happen to have not collected some random bit of data. But that’s doesn’t explain every gap in the data. This book explores the gender data gap - which is where we often seem to lack the data that we need to understand how different e.g. health outcomes affect women. The author argues comes about by a kind of selective blindness, as a kind of collective failure to think about gender. That means that the gender data gap isn’t really a conscious omission - we didn’t all set out to ignore women, but something a bit more subtle about what we collectively assume is worth measuring, and what the sensible defaults might be for that. Nice quick examples abound - really great one about office temperates which I’m sure will chime with all of us, but great to see it explained as a consequence of assumptions about what a typical office worker would be (a mythical 70kg 40 year old man from some point in the 1960s, basically). So it’s a great introduction to understanding the view that much data work is male-unless-something, and how that functions as both a cause, and as a consequence of the gender data gap."

Kevin’s thoughts on that are highly transferable to the kinds of questions that we’re thinking about today - how to take a system apart, make sense of the bits, then recombine them into a more useful new system.

Now, instead of manually analysing the weekly data to generate charts to be copied into a PowerPoint pack, I only need to refresh the data source and export the updated PowerBI report as a PDF. 1-2 hrs of work reduced to seconds :)\nCalmly dealt with numerous difficult colleagues and taken the initiative in the absence of more senior staff"

Proud of myself for not hiding away from the confrontation! 💪\nI’ve been working on speaking confidently whilst presenting data (I really struggle with this). Yesterday I managed to do a great presentation and answer questions confidently. Very proud!"

This week’s book of the week was suggested by Zena Trendell, a Programme Manager at NHS Lothian. She writes: ‘I recently read The Clean Code by Robert Cecil Martin. I’m not a coder but thought it was very good. The book is about professionalism for developers (similar to accountants etc.) and give you some tools to help prevent feeling under pressure re: timescales. It’s not a recent book yet very relevant to some incidents that have happened lately.’.\nUnsubscribe from these emails"
