All staff will have access to the online version of the app. You can find the app within the office application launcher (the waffle icon in the top left of the screen when using any office 365 applications on the web) (Figure 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: How to find Visio within the application launcher on 365 online.\n\n\n\nVisio can be employed for a variety of uses, such as:\n\nProcess mapping;\nFlowcharts;\nMatrices;\nVenn diagrams;\n‘Swim lane’ diagrams;\nStep plans such as communication plans.\n\nVisio has several set templates that can allow users to begin from a pre-designed example. This can enable users to quickly produce a clear, concise and professional looking diagram if they know the format they would like to present their information in."

    "text": "How to use Visio\n\nBlank template\nIf starting with a blank template, your workspace will be a clear page. Visio will provide a ‘shapes’ tab on the left side, with which you can begin clicking and dragging to populate the diagram.\nN.B. If you are doing traditional flowchart process mapping, certain shapes have certain meanings. For example, a circle usually denotes the start/end of a process, and a diamond denotes a decision (which will have branching YES or NO results). For more information, see Process Mapping Symbols in the appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The ‘blank template’ work screen of Visio\n\n\n\nOnce on the page, Shapes can:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: When right clicking on a shape, the options provided will allow you to change the size of the shape (a), appearance of the shape (b), or become a button via insert a link (c).\n\n\n\n\nChange size: Click on the shape and click + drag on the points that appear at its corners/edges to alter its dimensions (Figure 3, a)\nChange appearance: Right click on the shape, and use the ‘shape fill’/’shape outline’/’weight’ and ‘dash’ icons that appear in the window to edit the appearance of the shape (Figure 3, b)\nContain a link: The shapes can be edited to become buttons that will send viewers to a hyperlink when clicked. Right click on the shape, choose link from the window, and enter the URL that you would like the shape to direct to. ‘Add display text’ will show text that appears when viewers hover over the button, you can use this to provide a simplified link address or additional context (Figure 3, c)\nBe connected to other shapes: hover over the shape (without clicking) and green points will appear. If you click and drag from these points, Visio will generate an arrow that can be connected to another shape. Alternatively, some directional arrows will appear around the shape; if you hover over these; Visio will suggest new shapes that you can choose from, and it will auto-populate that shape connected to your original shape. (Figure 4)\n\nOther options are available to you on the Shapes panel on the left side of the workspace:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: If using the suggested arrows to generate shapes and connectors, hover over the arrows, choose the desired shape, and a new shape will be created connected via arrow to the original shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Basic shapes (a), more complicated arrows and connectors (b), stencil (c) (note this is a feature available only to a paid/upgraded Visio application and will not be available to staff by default), add shapes from other libraries/templates (d), and search for a shape by text (e). This is useful if looking for a specific shape to populate into your diagram, such as an email or document icon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking from pre-designed templates\nIf starting with a suggested template, your shapes panel on the left side will appear slightly different, to provide shapes that match the diagram intended. For example, if you are looking to create a Venn diagram, the shapes panel on the left will provide you with suggested overlapping shapes of 2-sets, 3-sets etc. Think (as a team if necessary), about what you are looking to produce before you begin and in what format this would look best/be most accessible/understandable, and choose the corresponding set template to get yourself started."

    "section": "Tips for getting the most out of Visio",
    "text": "Tips for getting the most out of Visio\n\nPlan out beforehand, either alone or with your team as appropriate, what format would work best for the information you are trying to provide. The same information can be provided in many different ways, and often one format will work better than another for the information you are trying to visualize. For example, a swim-lane diagram is better than a traditional process map when attempting to show responsibilities moving across different contributors/organisations.\nOnce you have a shape on the diagram that works well (has been sized, coloured and outlined in the manner that you want), you can copy and paste this shape instead of having to create it from scratch again. This helps massively with saving time, and helps generate a uniform formatting within the diagram.\nVisio’s workspace is reactive and will automatically grow if you exceed its borders. This is useful to know as it means you do not constantly have to move or re-shape your items to remain within the borders of the page. You may find it easier to generate all of the items for your diagram first, and move/locate/connect them all later on, once you have a feel for the amount of space your diagram requires.\nInclude a legend – provide a legend somewhere alongside the diagram, indicating what the different shapes, colours and connections mean (especially if the diagram becomes more complicated).\nIf it is difficult to fill in pieces of a process map because the information is poor or there is no information, don’t worry - this is also really useful information! Mapping out systems can identify gaps or weaknesses in the current process. Wherever this occurs, make a note of it, and when analysing the map with the team during review, explain the difficulties encountered to the team. This will prompt them to provide the missing information, and/or cause them to review the current process for quality improvement."

    "text": "Time to complete/resource allocation\nSimple Visio mapping can be quite quick, especially if using suggested template shapes to complete a task. However, complex diagrams can be quite tedious and time consuming to prepare.\nAs a result, any team member undertaking a complex process mapping task should be able to discuss with their line/work management how much time they can allocate to this, reasonable/realistic deadlines, and expectations alongside other work. If generating a visualisation like this is urgent, then the team member should be able to give priority over their other work to the task.\nProcess mapping is an excellent development opportunity as it is a flexible skill valuable to many different roles and teams. Anyone should be encouraged to try out using the tool where relevant to their work, or simply as a PDP exercise to familiarize themselves with the process."

Include a couple of decisions that create branching routes, e.g. do you walk to work &gt; Yes / No &gt; map an alternative route to work if you take the bus.\nPractice Comms: use one of the Infographics templates to make a short summary of your team’s milestones over the last year or in the year ahead."

First, we’ve got a few completely non-standard dates:\n\nraw |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(`date collected`, \"eve\")) |&gt;\n  select(PracticeCode, `date collected`)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  PracticeCode `date collected`\n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n1        55291 Christmas eve   \n\n\nShort of manually replacing them, we can’t do much about those. But we can fix the other dates, which are in Excel 1900 format:\n\nraw |&gt;\n  select(`date collected`) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 1\n  `date collected`\n  &lt;chr&gt;           \n1 45662           \n2 45665           \n3 45654           \n4 45659           \n5 45646           \n\n\nExcel counts days from Jan 1st 1900, while R counts days from Jan 1st 1970. That means that you need to subtract those 70 years to convert from one to the other, and then use lubridates as_date to convert that number of days into a proper R date. The quick-and-dirty way - just subtract 70 years-worth of days, which is (of course) 25569 days:\n\nraw |&gt;\n  mutate(`date collected` = as_date(as.numeric(`date collected`) - 25569)) |&gt; # 25569 is the magic number\n  select(`date collected`) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 1\n  `date collected`\n  &lt;date&gt;          \n1 2025-01-01      \n2 2024-12-20      \n3 2025-01-04      \n4 2024-12-28      \n5 2025-01-05      \n\n\nA nicer, more explicit, approach is to set an origin for your as_date to count from. Weirdly, because of a decades-old glitch in Excel dates, that’s two days before the 1st Jan 1900:\n\nraw |&gt;\n  mutate(`date collected` = as_date(as.numeric(`date collected`), origin = \"1899-12-30\")) |&gt;\n  select(`date collected`) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 1\n  `date collected`\n  &lt;date&gt;          \n1 2024-12-24      \n2 2024-12-23      \n3 2025-01-05      \n4 2024-12-28      \n5 2025-01-02      \n\n\nThere’s lots to say about date parsing - and would recommend coming to our lubridate session if you’d like to know more."

    "text": "Factors are confusing!\nFactors are confusing, but also factors are powerful. The reason they’re powerful is they give you proper tools for managing categorical data, and especially caregorical data that has a fixed order. Let’s set up an example to play with. Take an ordinary vector of character strings:\n\noct_s &lt;- c(\"Tweak\", \"Barnacles\", \"Dashi\", \"Kwazii\")\n\nWe can convert that into a factor:\n\noct_f &lt;- factor(oct_s)\n\nTo see what difference that’s made, let’s call up both the string vector and the factor:\n\noct_s\n\n[1] \"Tweak\"     \"Barnacles\" \"Dashi\"     \"Kwazii\"   \n\noct_f\n\n[1] Tweak     Barnacles Dashi     Kwazii   \nLevels: Barnacles Dashi Kwazii Tweak\n\n\nSo we’ve gained a new part in the factor: levels. You can think of levels as the possible values that our factor might contain. By default, when you create a factor from some strings, it takes the unique values, puts them in alphabetical order, and uses those as the levels:\n\nlevels(oct_f) # alphabetical\n\n[1] \"Barnacles\" \"Dashi\"     \"Kwazii\"    \"Tweak\"    \n\n\nIn fact, if you look carefully at the structure of a factor, you’ll see something surprising:\n\ntypeof(oct_f)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nSo factors are basically vectors of integers, with each integer standing in for one of the possible levels. This makes factors more efficient than ordinary strings:\n\n# guess who's been reading Advanced R\nlobstr::obj_size(sample(oct_s, 100000, T))\n\n800.28 kB\n\nlobstr::obj_size(sample(oct_f, 100000, T))\n\n400.70 kB\n\n\nIt also means that we get to use some of the number-oriented tools to work with categorical data:\n\nsummary(sample(oct_s, 100000, T))\n\n   Length     Class      Mode \n   100000 character character \n\nsummary(sample(oct_f, 100000, T)) # nice frequency table with no effort\n\nBarnacles     Dashi    Kwazii     Tweak \n    24854     24812     25414     24920 \n\n\nThings get really interesting when we realise we can change the order of levels from the default alphabetical ordering:\n\noct_f_l &lt;- factor(oct_s, levels = c(\"Dashi\", \"Tweak\", \"Barnacles\", \"Kwazii\"))\n\noct_f_l\n\n[1] Tweak     Barnacles Dashi     Kwazii   \nLevels: Dashi Tweak Barnacles Kwazii\n\n\nThat’s very interesting, because the ordering of factors gets preserved in all kinds of places:\n\noct_f_l_tibble &lt;- tibble(oct_f_l,\n                         score = c(7,5,9,4)) \n\noct_f_l_tibble |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = oct_f_l, y = score, fill = oct_f_l)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noct_f_l_tibble |&gt;\n  group_by(oct_f_l) |&gt;\n  summarise(score = score * 20)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  oct_f_l   score\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Dashi       180\n2 Tweak       140\n3 Barnacles   100\n4 Kwazii       80\n\n\nIf you want to get fancy with factors, the forcats package has some great tools. Some quick examples:\n\noct_s |&gt;\n  factor() |&gt;\n  fct_inorder() |&gt; # build a factor with levels in order of appearance\n  levels()\n\n[1] \"Tweak\"     \"Barnacles\" \"Dashi\"     \"Kwazii\"   \n\n\n\noct_plot &lt;- oct_f_l_tibble |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = score, fill = oct_f_l)) \n\noct_plot +\n  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(oct_f_l, c(4,2,3,1)))) # re-order levels in place\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noct_plot +\n  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(oct_f_l, -score))) # order levels by other values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample 1: forcing non-alphabetical ordering\n\nmonth_v &lt;- month.name[1:4]\n\nmonth_f &lt;- factor(month_v, levels = c(\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\"))\n\n# or fct_inorder(factor(month.name[1:4])) would get you there too\n\ntibble(month = month_f,\n       values = c(99,55,22,101)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = month, y = values))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntibble(month = month_f,\n       values = c(99,55,22,101)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(month, -values), y = values))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample 2: dealing with numeric categories\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = hp, colour = gear)) # continuous presentation of categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = hp, colour = factor(gear)))"

    "text": "How do I filter based on dates?\nThere are a couple of tips here. First, make sure that you’re working with dates from as early in the process as possible. Don’t try and cheat with text strings:\n\ndat &lt;- tibble(\n  date = c(\"01/02/2024\", \"01/04/2024\", \"01/06/2024\"),\n  val = c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\")\n) |&gt;\n  mutate(date = dmy(date)) \n\ndat\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date       val  \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2024-02-01 one  \n2 2024-04-01 two  \n3 2024-06-01 three\n\n\nThe second big bit of advice is to pick an approach to dates, and stick with it for everything. I like lubridate, but you might prefer doing dates in base R, or data.table, or something else. Whichever system you prefer, stick to one - it’ll save masses of pain in the long-run.\nI like lubridate for this sort of work, because (to my mind) it has the easiest set of parsing functions to make dates from values:\n\nydm(\"2021-28-4\") # including some horrible formats\n\n[1] \"2021-04-28\"\n\nym(\"199907\")\n\n[1] \"1999-07-01\"\n\nym(\"199907\") + days(11) # with additional setting\n\n[1] \"1999-07-12\"\n\nceiling_date(ym(\"199907\"), \"months\")\n\n[1] \"1999-08-01\"\n\n\nYou should be able to dplyr::filter your data in a few ways:\n\ndat |&gt;\n  filter(date == \"2024-04-01\") # assuming you remember how R dates are formatted\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  date       val  \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2024-04-01 two  \n\ndat |&gt;\n  filter(date == ymd(\"2024-04-01\")) # probably safer to convert the string to a date\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  date       val  \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2024-04-01 two  \n\ndat |&gt;\n  filter(date &gt;= ymd(\"2022-04-01\")) # inequality filtering\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date       val  \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2024-02-01 one  \n2 2024-04-01 two  \n3 2024-06-01 three\n\ndat |&gt;\n  filter(date &gt;= ymd(\"2022-04-01\") + years(2)) # filtering with offset\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  date       val  \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2024-04-01 two  \n2 2024-06-01 three\n\ndat |&gt;\n  filter(date %within% interval(\"2024-03-01\", \"2024-05-01\")) # %within% is basically %in% for dates\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  date       val  \n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 2024-04-01 two"

    "text": "How can I swap colour palettes in ggplot\nThere are several different strategies that might be useful for tweaking ggplot colours. Let’s set up a quick factors plot based on months:\n\nfactors_plot &lt;- tibble(month = month_f,\n       values = c(99,55,22,101)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(month, -values), \n               y = values, \n               fill = fct_reorder(month, -values))) \n\nfactors_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can manually assign colours. R recognises about 600 different ordinary colour names:\n\nfactors_plot + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"green\", \"black\", \"grey\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, with more precision, you can specify hex values:\n\nfactors_plot + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#115599\", \"#aa1199\", \"black\", \"#ff6600\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is fine for simple plots, or when you have e.g. specific colour palettes to use (like you might find in an organisational style manual). But for one-off or more sophisticated uses, it’s definitely worth exploring ColorBrewer - especially because this has great support for producing accessible colour palettes:\n\nfactors_plot + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"RdBu\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a nice weird trick: you can reverse the default order that ggplot creates fill colours using scales::hue_pal:\n\nfactors_plot +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = scales::hue_pal(direction = 1)(4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfactors_plot +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = scales::hue_pal(direction = -1)(4))"

We’ll remove some of the values from our b1 set and from our b2 set:\n\nb1 &lt;- b1 |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\nb1\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy  0.590\n2 victoria 0.248\n3 peter    0.644\n4 judi     0.887\n5 paul     0.336\n\n\n\nb2 &lt;- b2 |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\nb2\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name     score\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 judi     0.887\n2 linsey   0.971\n3 victoria 0.248\n4 peter    0.644\n5 jennifer 0.160\n\n\nThe simplest join we could do is to bind the rows from one set onto another:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  bind_rows(b2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   name     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 kennedy  0.590\n 2 victoria 0.248\n 3 peter    0.644\n 4 judi     0.887\n 5 paul     0.336\n 6 judi     0.887\n 7 linsey   0.971\n 8 victoria 0.248\n 9 peter    0.644\n10 jennifer 0.160\n\n\nThat just brings all the rows from b2 onto the end of b1. Unlike binding, though, in a join we usually want to only include some of our values. So let’s now left-join b2:\n\nb1 |&gt;\n  left_join(b2, by = \"name\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  name     score.x score.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 kennedy    0.590  NA    \n2 victoria   0.248   0.248\n3 peter      0.644   0.644\n4 judi       0.887   0.887\n5 paul       0.336  NA    \n\n\nYou should see that only the values from b2’s score column that have a corresponding name in b1 get populated, and everything else gets filled with NAs. Here’s a nice introduction to the different kinds of join you can do in dplyr."

Very chuffed with myself!\nJoined the R from Scratch session this week after not using R for almost a year and found that I actually remembered quite a lot of the content that was being taught.

This is a fun and thought-provoking set of essays about bureacracy. It starts with a mystery: why, if people hate bureaucracy, is there so much of it?. A recurring theme in many KIND events that we spend lots of time managing forms and paperwork, rather than doing more important work. And so we might be reassured that it’s not just us, that ‘all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day taken up in the filling out of forms.’ The most interesting parts of this book though are not about just moaning about the quantity of paperwork that we face, but instead point out exactly why all that paperwork might really be something to worry about. As the author notes, endless box ticking seems to prevent useful communication and other human interactions. Or, more cuttingly: ‘Bureaucratic procedures…make even the smartest people act like idiots’. That point then leads into a balancing act. As the title might suggest, some rules seem to constrain or prevent us doing useful things, while some rules seem to do the opposite (say, by insisting that we can’t discriminate based on appearance). So there’s a balancing act between different kinds of rules, that shows up as a long-running back and forth between different ways of ruling, that the author traces across times and places. That range of cases, and pleasure in talking about paperwork, is a substantial contributor to the great charm of the book..\nUnsubscribe from these emails"

This book, which is a lively and provoking introduction to the frequency format hypothesis might give us cause for pause: it turns out that frequencies serve as much stronger communicators of risk than probabilities. So if you want to communicate a risk, there’s a good reason to prefer saying 8 out of 10 people rather than 80% of people."

The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy. ISBN 978-1612195186, Worldcat link.\n This is a fun and thought-provoking set of essays about bureacracy. It starts with a mystery: why, if people hate bureaucracy, is there so much of it?. A recurring theme in many KIND events that we spend lots of time managing forms and paperwork, rather than doing more important work. And so we might be reassured that it’s not just us, that ‘all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day taken up in the filling out of forms.’ The most interesting parts of this book though are not about just moaning about the quantity of paperwork that we face, but instead point out exactly why all that paperwork might really be something to worry about. As the author notes, endless box ticking seems to prevent useful communication and other human interactions. Or, more cuttingly: ‘Bureaucratic procedures…make even the smartest people act like idiots’. That point then leads into a balancing act. As the title might suggest, some rules seem to constrain or prevent us doing useful things, while some rules seem to do the opposite (say, by insisting that we can’t discriminate based on appearance). So there’s a balancing act between different kinds of rules, that shows up as a long-running back and forth between different ways of ruling, that the author traces across times and places. That range of cases, and pleasure in talking about paperwork, is a substantial contributor to the great charm of the book."

This book looks across a series of ordinary activities to show how, a decade or so ago, algorithms were shaping our lives. While the tech may have moved on, the moral of the work remains: algorithms are capable of serious harms if they are designed and applied thoughtlessly. I’d make this compulsory reading for colleagues working with data if I could - not least because it’s a surprisingly engaging read given the serious subject-matter. The data that we work with can have all kinds of unpredictable destinations, and the potential scope of end-uses of that data should be considered when building tools that collect and combine powerful data. Again, it’s another reminder that data with enough power to effect positive change will often be usable to bring about harms."

In the training session, we ended up in an interesting conversation about the rate of change of facts in health. That rate of change (or, to jump ahead a bit, the rate of decay) of the facts was a surprise to some of us. So I wanted to highlight this useful book, which gives a lot of examples of changing facts. That’s accompanied by a useful discussion of the causes and consequences of changing facts - how they spread, how we get tripped up by them, and what we might do to deal more elegantly with knowledge that’s always a bit unstable."

Although originally written for medical students, this book is an excellent quick source of reliable knowledge about core statistical pricinples and techniques. I’m recommending an older edition - and there are lots of newer editions available too - partly because this older edition is much more concise than the later versions, but also because this edition is one of the very few books that I’ve used every week or so since I was a student, particularly for the statistical tables and test selection flowcharts.

She writes: ‘The author discusses relatively new research that sees a strong interconnection between our interroception, our immune system, and emotions, showing how intertwined psychology and medicine are. She makes a strong case for the whole-system-approach, because isolated symptoms can easily be mislabelled by both practitioners and patients. The book also includes a critical perspective on the still prevalent methodology of studying emotions and mental illness.’ It’s an excellent book, and one that’s particularly refreshing in a field that’s dominated in the popular view by a series of works from the nineteenth century - the Bells, the Duchennes, and the Darwins especially."

A spectacular increase in a previously-rare limb abnormality called phocomelia, even though a cause of widespread alarm amongst paediatricians, did not prevent the continued marketing of the drug. This book, which takes a long and cold look at this ‘disaster’, with particular attention to the greatly-enhanced safety research that became required for new medicines as a consequence. This change was in large part due to one of the great heroes of obstinancy, Frances O. Kelsey, and her tenacious work in demanding higher standards for FDA drug approvals. Also highly recommended is the short review of this book in Nature from a lost era when high-quality book reviews were still a priority for academic publishers."

That brings me to a first, which is a BotW recommendation that comes with a competing interest as it was written by a former colleague of mine. This excellent short account of Harvey’s work in the mid-seventeenth century, culminating in the publication of De Motu Cordis in 1628, takes us through the story of blood circulation, with some thoughtful discussions about the reasons why some researchers appear to us now so keen to mislead. De Motu Cordis was also the oldest book that I know of whose publication was managed to co-incide with the Frankfurt book fair, so that’s another interesting first for the week."

This book describes several agnotologies - cases where doubt (about the likely environmental impacts of pollution, say) - and then uses those cases to set up a thoughtful discussion about uncertainty and understanding. For us, who often work with data and evidence which might be at least somewhat open to interpretation, it’s an excellent reminder to think carefully about the interpretations that might be placed on our work. It’s not enough, as these cases clearly show, to try and let the data speak for itself - particularly when (in some cases) there are parties who seek advantage by muffling and confusing that speech."

It starts by telling the story of the ‘discovery’ of the Wassermann reaction, and uses that history as the basis for an investigation of the ways in which people came to a) claim that the Wassermann reaction worked because of scientific facts and b) how those facts changes as the Wassermann reaction became used in practice.  From the KIND-ish stance much of the interest lies in the parts of this book that describe how medical research wasn’t the straightforwardly objective story about discovery that we often want to portray. Fleck’s claim, broadly, is that the Wassermann reaction was invented, rather than discovered, and that invention reflected (in part) the social organisation of researchers and others involved in its discovery. Of particular interest to people like us are a series of claims about how facts change as they travel out from the specialist communities that work on them. We’re all familiar with the changes that happen (and need to happen) as we pass the results of our work out to their eventual users: they often get simplified, or put in context, or whatever."

Rest assured that the title of Gould’s The Mismeasure of Man is a pun: both on the idea that man is the measure of all things [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/protagoras/], and on precisely the kind of not-thinking that we discussed last time.  This is a book about the history of measuring intelligence, and why we might worry about collapsing all possible measures of intelligence to a single number, like IQ. That story is told through a diverting series of detailed historical reconstructions about methods used to measure intelligence and related human features. Lots of this is about measuring skulls, and if you’re into that sort of history of science, seeing the kinds of dispute that switching between lead shot and mustard seed as measures of brain volume might cause is worth the investment - not least because it has surprisingly contemporary connections to the anthropometrical work that still powers much of modern ergonomics, human factors, etc. But the real value for most of us who do KIND-ish work isn’t this rich historical detail, fun though it is. It is instead about the abstractions about complicated human activities that lie close to the surface of our work. Every time we report a figure that collapses a complex activity into a single value we should be careful - particularly when that abstraction might well be influenced by our existing beliefs and practices. might shape that collapse.”"

This book explores the gender data gap - which is where we often seem to lack the data that we need to understand how different e.g. health outcomes affect women. The author argues comes about by a kind of selective blindness, as a kind of collective failure to think about gender. That means that the gender data gap isn’t really a conscious omission - we didn’t all set out to ignore women, but something a bit more subtle about what we collectively assume is worth measuring, and what the sensible defaults might be for that. Nice quick examples abound - really great one about office temperates which I’m sure will chime with all of us, but great to see it explained as a consequence of assumptions about what a typical office worker would be (a mythical 70kg 40 year old man from some point in the 1960s, basically). So it’s a great introduction to understanding the view that much data work is male-unless-something, and how that functions as both a cause, and as a consequence of the gender data gap."

ISBN 978-1472918338, Worldcat link.\n We’re looking at regular expressions in the community meetup today. Regex, as the wikipedia page suggests, have been around for ages - positively archaeological in computing terms. So for the book of the week this week, I wanted to show off one of the most interesting bits of social history I’ve read: Tom Lean’s Electronic Dreams. Lots of the history of computing is either primarily about the technical details, or is a broadly nostalgic look at obsolete tech. This book doesn’t do either of those, instead spending its time giving a concise account of how personal computing worked as a social phenomenon. For example, how did people start getting paid to write computer games? What happened when the BBC got involved in personal computing? What happened to the various promises of digital revolutions as a replacement for manufacturing industries."

It’s the autobiography of Kevin Mitnick (2011 Ghost in the Wires) who was (briefly) the most wanted hacker in the world. Looking at the blurb of this ghosted book, you’d expect it be bepretty predictable - smarter than everyone else, playing pranks, evading capture until… That story is definitely there (there’s plenty of broad-but-exciting plot here), but for KIND purposes there’s something much more interesting, which is an insight into the kind of analytical thinking that lies at the heart of finding things out about complex systems. Kevin’s thoughts on that are highly transferable to the kinds of questions that we’re thinking about today - how to take a system apart, make sense of the bits, then recombine them into a more useful new system. Also, there are codes - really hard codes for emphasis - for the reader to break. That’s a lovely bonus - especially if you looked into Simon Singh’s The Code Book from last time."

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"

Those mistakes are a vital part of learning, and we need our events to allow people to learn without the fear of looking foolish for posterity\nmost of our events are social. In the little bit of A/B testing I did early in the life of the network, recording events decreased the number of social interactions - like questions or chat comments - in meetings\nour training is problem-based, and built for attendees to learn by doing. That doesn’t translate well at all to video\nthe actual view counts for recorded events are tiny, meaning that the benefits of recordings look low from here\n\nSpecifically, we require that attendees at our meetings and training sessions do not use AI/LLM-based recording- or note-taking bots or apps.

Writing an effective search can take a bit of thought, but the most useful guidance is to include as much specific information in your search as you can. So that means mention package/function names, any error messages received, and a description of the error that you’re facing. It’s definitely worth playing around a bit with this too - I like including the whole error message in quotes to sharpen the search up..

Code-y types might refer to this as a reprex - a reproducible example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure that you don’t breach data protection rules when you share your issue. Replacing any real data with sample data is generally the safest course of action\n\n\nThat can be daunting, so here are some steps to help achieve a minimal example:\n\nstart with your spreadsheet/script that’s causing trouble, and save a copy of it as your mini-example\nremove any irrelevant material, leaving just the part with the error, and anything that depends on\n\nif in doubt, take it out. Keep it as simple as possible!\n\nreplace any real data with suitable placeholder data if there are any concerns about data protection\n\ndon’t make helpers guess what your data is like!\n\nnext, make sure that your error still occurs in your mini-example. Stripping away extraneous material etc is a great way of actually fixing problems in its own right, so it’s important to check that you haven’t fixed it by yourself\n\nyou should also make sure that any password protection, credentials, etc are removed from the document so that your helpers can see everything you can see\n\nfinally, make sure you save your example file before adding it to your request for help in Teams"

The reason for this is that Arti has a row in each dataset. Anyone without corresponding rows gets filling in with blanks.\nWe could do something very similar by hand in Excel. It’s worth noting the VSTACK function, which allows you to bring one table into another in Excel. PowerQuery has some great tools for binding data. Append Queries allows you to perform row-binding:\n\n\n\nSelect Append Queries\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect datasets to bind together\n\n\n\n\n\nNew table containing all rows from the original\n\n\nHowever we bind, the main distinction remains the same.

Now, instead of manually analysing the weekly data to generate charts to be copied into a PowerPoint pack, I only need to refresh the data source and export the updated PowerBI report as a PDF. 1-2 hrs of work reduced to seconds :)\nCalmly dealt with numerous difficult colleagues and taken the initiative in the absence of more senior staff"

That’s an adaptation of our existing Power BI course to use the web version of Power BI, which I hope will improve some of the Power BI licencing issues that some learners have faced. Hope to see you there 10.00-12.00 this coming Thursday.\nWe also have a couple of spaces available on our EBM introductory course running weekly Wednesdays 14.00-16.00 from September 11th until October 9th. Please get in touch if you’d like one of the available slots.\nFinally, we’ll be scheduling training sessions for November and December next week. Please get in touch ASAP if you’d like some training for your team. We can potentially offer any of our multi-session courses or any of our one-off sessions to you and your team free of charge. All that we ask is that you can commit to having 15-20 staff attend the sessions, and that you can take care of any admin and infrastructure requirements such as circulating invites, installing software etc.\nHope to see you at something soon\nBrendan"

For many of us who work with knowledge, information, and data, the natural way of doing that is by talking about probabilities. This book, which is a lively and provoking introduction to the frequency format hypothesis might give us cause for pause: it turns out that frequencies serve as much stronger communicators of risk than probabilities. So if you want to communicate a risk, there’s a good reason to prefer saying 8 out of 10 people rather than 80% of people.”, “This week’s recommendation comes from Kelsey Pearson a Business Intelligence Analyst at the University of Edinburgh. They write: ‘Harry Parker lost his legs to an IED in Afghanistan and now has prosthetic legs. He goes on to learn about medical technology and their implications for what it means to be human. He learns about early examples of prosthetics and technology (e.g. iron lungs) used to support those with disabilities and illnesses. He also learns about current and future technological advancements such as brain chips, bionic eyes, and exoskeletons. I enjoyed the discussions around identity and whether we’re all hybrids to some degree. Think about your phone, headphones, and smartwatch…’”, “This week’s recommendation comes from Alupha Chan, a Research IT Facilitator at NHS Tayside who writes: ‘I think this book will go well with this group. This used to be a mandatory reading for my Communications (PR) dip. nearly 2 decades ago - one of the chapters is dedicated in looking at whether presented stats are deceptive.’ Having had a look at this book, I’d recommend it too - lots of great material here for thinking hard about more complicated questions.”, “This is a high-risk recommendation, because I’ve only read a few chapters of this friendly (and alarming) introduction to AI. But there’s a good reason for the slightly-impetuous premature recommendation, as the public sector Data Ethics and Society Reading Group will be hosting a session on the book on the 3rd of December, so just about time to get a copy if you fancy joining what should be an excellent discussion then.”, “This week’s recommendation comes from Louise Stuart, a Health and Work Adviser at Public Health Scotland, who writes: ‘I used to work as an OT in a low secure forensic mental health hospital so it was nostalgic to revisit my time on the wards through this book. The author offers a compassionate insight into those who are accessing forensic mental health services with each chapter focusing on a different patients story and journey. I found this book to be a powerful and thoughtful read, and I would thoroughly recommend.’”, “Colin Smith, an information analyst at NHS GGC writes to recommend this book: ‘A very interesting book from 2016. Not medical but given we’ve another potential round of ’austerity’ on the way, still relevant as to how we run the economy and fund the NHS and public services.’”).\nUnsubscribe from these emails"

This can be a tough period for many, so the selection this week celebrates colleagues who have had a tricky time recently:\n\nI put my hand up to say I’m struggling. Takes a lot for me to admit that I need help. but reminding myself that its not a sign of weakness. And the plus is that I was heard and supported. So going into the weekend feeling more positive.\nDespite my brain’s best efforts, I managed to be productive this week and did everything I was asked and promised to do.\nNot really much of an achievement but I have survived the first full week back to work after the two short weeks of the festive period, and it’s not been too bad!! Looking forward to the weekend though!\nStarted back into this project from before christmas that’s been making me very anxious. I’m doing it!\n\nWell done all, and looking forward to hearing your wins of the week in future."

Hope you’re keeping safe.\nA retrospective notice of an interesting resource: the Knowledge Network produced an excellent Sway full of resources for health information week. Highly recommended.\nWe’ve also got the first of our 2025 run of community meetup sessions happening next week. That’s kindly been offered by Richard Hassett, a specialist senior prescribing support technician from NHS GGC. He writes:\n\nI have fairly recently been gifted the task of running some R scripting to produce medication adherence visualisations for a number of secondary care consultants working in my health board. It aims to support easy identification of sub-optimal medication adherence and trigger a conversation between clinician and patient…I’d like some help to better understand what it is doing. Through a process of trial and error I can usually resolve but I’m concerned I’m messing things up in the background. Secondly, it seems rather complex and so I wonder if there is scope to simplify or automate more of it…\n\nThis should be an excellent session for R-enthusiasts to come together to support an innovative and useful project. Please consider coming along if you can between 3.30-4.30 next Tuesday.\nBrendan"

    "text": "Is there a nice way to write formatted dates to xlsx/csv?\nYes, there is. In fact, there are a couple of ways of doing it. The ‘proper’ way for Excel is to use the openxlsx package to set a date format. This is great when it works, but pretty complicated to set up. And I need to extend thanks to Kirsty Mangin (NHS Golden Jubilee) for coming to the rescue with the following code:\n\nlibrary(openxlsx)\ndat &lt;- readxl::read_xlsx(\"s01_data.xlsx\") # here's the data we want to format\n\nfilename &lt;- \"openxlsx.xlsx\" # for the new .xlsx file we're going to create\nwb &lt;- createWorkbook(title = filename) # create an openxlsx workbook object in R\naddWorksheet(wb = wb, \"sheet one\") # add a worksheet to that book named \"sheet one\"\nwriteData(wb = wb, \n          x = dat,\n          sheet= \"sheet one\", \n          startCol=1, \n          startRow=1, \n          colNames=TRUE) # write the data into that worksheet\n\ndate_style &lt;- createStyle(\n  fgFill = '#FFFFCC',\n  numFmt = \"dd/mm/yyyy\",\n  border = 'TopBottomLeftRight',\n  borderStyle = 'thin') # then create a date style\n\naddStyle(wb, \n         sheet=\"sheet one\", \n         date_style,  \n         gridExpand=T, \n         cols = 1, \n         rows = 1:nrow(dat)) # then apply that date style\n\nsaveWorkbook(wb, \"styled.xlsx\") # finally, save the workbook\n\n\n\n\nLovely styled dates\n\n\nThis is fantastic, but bulky. If you’re after something more casual (and more .csv friendly) you can convert your date to a formatted text string using lubridate:\n\nreadxl::read_xlsx(\"data/s01_data.xlsx\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(nice_date = lubridate::stamp_date(\"Jan 13 2021\")(date)) \n\n# A tibble: 1,500 × 6\n   date                WardName OccupiedBeds BedComp ClosedBed nice_date  \n   &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 2022-11-02 00:00:00 A                  16      20         2 Nov 02 2022\n 2 2022-11-02 00:00:00 B                  20      20         0 Nov 02 2022\n 3 2022-11-02 00:00:00 C                  21      22         1 Nov 02 2022\n 4 2022-11-02 00:00:00 D                  25      30         2 Nov 02 2022\n 5 2022-11-02 00:00:00 E                  15      22         3 Nov 02 2022\n 6 2022-11-03 00:00:00 A                  14      20         0 Nov 03 2022\n 7 2022-11-03 00:00:00 B                  19      20         3 Nov 03 2022\n 8 2022-11-03 00:00:00 C                  18      22         0 Nov 03 2022\n 9 2022-11-03 00:00:00 D                  26      30         0 Nov 03 2022\n10 2022-11-03 00:00:00 E                  13      22         0 Nov 03 2022\n# ℹ 1,490 more rows"

    "text": "Any tips for working in R with limited RAM?\nThis was an inquiry from someone trying to work in R in Windows with 8gB of RAM. That’s going to be a challenge, unfortunately, especially if you need to run other memory-hungry stuff concurrently (Teams, e.g). R doesn’t have much in the way of memory management, so aside from patience, the general advice is to keep e.g. the data that you’re working with as small as possible. You’ll usually load your working data into memory, and so if that data is larger than the available memory R will slow to a crawl as it’s forced to write that data back to disk again.\nOne important exception: R gets very memory-inefficient if you grow objects. If you’ve got a choice between growing an object:\n\na &lt;- vector(\"numeric\")\n\nfor (i in 1:100){\n  a &lt;- c(a, i)\n}\n\nOr creating an object, and then assigning into it:\n\nb &lt;- vector(\"numeric\", 100L)\nfor (i in 1:100){\n  b[i] &lt;- i\n}\n\nYou should always choose the latter."

First, and unlike vectors, lists can contain several different types of data:\n\nlist(\"clive\", 99:1, penguins[2,])\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"clive\"\n\n[[2]]\n [1] 99 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 91 90 89 88 87 86 85 84 83 82 81 80 79 78 77 76 75\n[26] 74 73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50\n[51] 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25\n[76] 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n[[3]]\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nAs that example shows, unlike tibbles, lists can be ragged, containing vectors of different lengths:\n\ntest_list &lt;- list(dunn = \"clive\", \n                  ready_or_not = 99:1,\n                  pengs = penguins) # or with names\n\nThere’s lots to say about working with lists, but the most helpful reminder is about subsetting. This can trip people up, because you can either return a vector:\n\ntest_list$dunn  # returns a vector\n\n[1] \"clive\"\n\ntest_list[[\"dunn\"]] # equivalent\n\n[1] \"clive\"\n\ntest_list[[1]] # subsetting by extracting a vector\n\n[1] \"clive\"\n\n\nOr you can return a smaller list:\n\ntest_list[1] # subsetting to return a mini-list\n\n$dunn\n[1] \"clive\"\n\n\nThe important thing is to be sure about exactly which of those you’re planning to do, and then check to make sure that you’re actually getting what you’d planned. And this minor pain-point is entirely worthwhile, because lists are so flexible. If in doubt, use a list."

But being able to build function calls in a different way, where their arguments are held in a list, can be extremely useful. do.call is also especially useful when you want to use operators as if they were standard functions:\n\nbig_nums &lt;- list(c(1:5), c(5:1))\ndo.call(\"*\", big_nums)\n\n[1] 5 8 9 8 5\n\n# or for collecting several arguments, and then evaluating them\narg &lt;- list(1:10, na.rm = T)\ndo.call(sum, args = arg)\n\n[1] 55\n\ndo.call(mean, args = arg)\n\n[1] 5.5"

Say you’ve got some odd non-vectorised function:\n\nfb &lt;- function(n){\n  out &lt;- \"\"\n  if (n %% 3 == 0) out &lt;- \"fizz\"\n  if (n %% 5 == 0) out &lt;- paste0(out, \"buzz\")\n  if(nchar(out) == 0) out &lt;- as.character(n)\n  out\n}\n\nThat works fine on single values, but chokes when supplied with several values:\n\nfb(8)\n\n[1] \"8\"\n\nfb(9)\n\n[1] \"fizz\"\n\ntry(fb(8:9))\n\nError in if (n%%3 == 0) out &lt;- \"fizz\" : the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nWe could lapply this, or map it, to produce a list of output:\n\nlapply(8:9, fb)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"8\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"fizz\"\n\nmap(8:9, fb)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"8\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"fizz\"\n\n\nBut the advantage of map is that we can trivially change the output by tweaking the function name. Rather than map we could return a character vector with map_chr:\n\nmap_chr(1:20, fb)\n\n [1] \"1\"        \"2\"        \"fizz\"     \"4\"        \"buzz\"     \"fizz\"    \n [7] \"7\"        \"8\"        \"fizz\"     \"buzz\"     \"11\"       \"fizz\"    \n[13] \"13\"       \"14\"       \"fizzbuzz\" \"16\"       \"17\"       \"fizz\"    \n[19] \"19\"       \"buzz\""

    "text": "This was about the names and values chapter in Advanced R (2nd ed). It’s mainly about understanding how objects are named in R, and what the implications are for ordinary R practitioners.\n\nlibrary(lobstr) # to help understand how objects are structured\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\n\nThe first point is about names. We usually think about assignment as making an object called x. But it’s definitely better to think about these separately - first creating an object and then binding it to a name. That means that names have objects, rather than objects having names.\n\nx &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) # create an object\nobj_addr(x) # location in memory\n\n[1] \"0x14ba179f718\"\n\ny &lt;- x # bind an additional name to the object\nobj_addr(x) == obj_addr(y) # it's just one object with two names\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThis applies to objects in general, including function definitions:\n\nobj_addr(mean)\n\n[1] \"0x14b9bba8068\"\n\nsteve &lt;- mean\nobj_addr(steve)\n\n[1] \"0x14b9bba8068\"\n\n\nWe only create a new object when we modify one of the names:\n\ny[3] &lt;- 9\nobj_addr(x) == obj_addr(y) # different objects now\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThere are a couple of important exceptions to this general principle. First, lists have an extra step, in that they refer to references, rather than to objects directly:\n\nl1 &lt;- list(1, 2, 3)\nl2 &lt;- l1\n\nobj_addr(l1)\n\n[1] \"0x14ba0bb7358\"\n\nobj_addr(l2)\n\n[1] \"0x14ba0bb7358\"\n\nl2[[3]] &lt;- 99\n\nobj_addr(l1)\n\n[1] \"0x14ba0bb7358\"\n\nobj_addr(l2)\n\n[1] \"0x14ba0da9948\"\n\nref(l1, l2)\n\n█ [1:0x14ba0bb7358] &lt;list&gt; \n├─[2:0x14b9e987040] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─[3:0x14b9e987008] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─[4:0x14b9e986fd0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n \n█ [5:0x14ba0da9948] &lt;list&gt; \n├─[2:0x14b9e987040] \n├─[3:0x14b9e987008] \n└─[6:0x14b9e986e80] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\n\nAs tibbles (and other tabular data structures in R) are effectively lists, this is an explaination as to why row-wise operations are so slow compared to operations on columns. As tibbles are are lists of columns, updating a column just makes a new reference. Changing a row, on the other hand, makes a whole new set of objects and references:\n\nmt_changed_col &lt;- mtcars\nmt_changed_col$hp &lt;- mtcars$hp*9\n\nmt_changed_row &lt;- mtcars\nmt_changed_row[1,] &lt;- mt_changed_row[1,] * 9\n\nref(mtcars, mt_changed_col, mt_changed_row)\n\n█ [1:0x14ba216fca8] &lt;df[,11]&gt; \n├─mpg = [2:0x14b980d5650] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─cyl = [3:0x14b980d5780] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─disp = [4:0x14b9bef4490] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─hp = [5:0x14b9bef38b0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─drat = [6:0x14b9bef45c0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─wt = [7:0x14b9bef4360] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─qsec = [8:0x14b9bef4f40] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─vs = [9:0x14b9bef46f0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─am = [10:0x14b9bef4820] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─gear = [11:0x14b9bef4950] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─carb = [12:0x14b9bef3780] &lt;dbl&gt; \n \n█ [13:0x14ba216f728] &lt;df[,11]&gt; \n├─mpg = [2:0x14b980d5650] \n├─cyl = [3:0x14b980d5780] \n├─disp = [4:0x14b9bef4490] \n├─hp = [14:0x14b9bef4a80] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─drat = [6:0x14b9bef45c0] \n├─wt = [7:0x14b9bef4360] \n├─qsec = [8:0x14b9bef4f40] \n├─vs = [9:0x14b9bef46f0] \n├─am = [10:0x14b9bef4820] \n├─gear = [11:0x14b9bef4950] \n└─carb = [12:0x14b9bef3780] \n \n█ [15:0x14ba2362b18] &lt;df[,11]&gt; \n├─mpg = [16:0x14b9bef39e0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─cyl = [17:0x14b9bef5400] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─disp = [18:0x14b9bef3ea0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─hp = [19:0x14b9bef4230] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─drat = [20:0x14b9bef3060] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─wt = [21:0x14b9bef4bb0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─qsec = [22:0x14b9bef5070] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─vs = [23:0x14b9bef4ce0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─am = [24:0x14b9bef4100] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─gear = [25:0x14b9bef33f0] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─carb = [26:0x14b9bef3520] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\ncol_row &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  {mt_changed_col &lt;- mtcars\n  mt_changed_col[\"hp\"] &lt;- mtcars[\"hp\"]*9},\n  \n  {mt_changed_row &lt;- mtcars\n  mt_changed_row[1,] &lt;- mt_changed_row[1,] * 9}\n)\n\ncol_row |&gt;\n  mutate(expr = case_when(stringr::str_detect(expr, \"col\") ~ \"by col\",\n                          TRUE ~ \"by row\"))  |&gt;\n  group_by(expr) |&gt;\n  summarise(`mean time (μs)` = mean(time)/1000) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable() # about 4x faster to change the col than the row\n\n\n\n\nexpr\nmean time (μs)\n\n\n\n\nby col\n297.377\n\n\nby row\n1051.283\n\n\n\n\nggplot2::autoplot(col_row)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also looked briefly at alternative representation. The range operator is the best example of highly compact representations:\n\nobj_size(1:1000000) # approx size?\n\n680 B\n\nobj_size(1:2) == obj_size(1:1000000) # the range operator only stores the first and last values\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nobj_size(seq(1, 1000000)) # seq will use the same alternative representation...\n\n680 B\n\nobj_size(seq(1, 1000000, 1.0)) # unless you ask it to make a sequence with non-1L steps \n\n8.00 MB\n\n\nobject.size has lots of interesting implications for lists as it only describes the size of the references, rather than the underlying objects:\n\nobj_size(rnorm(1e6)) # 8 mb\n\n8.00 MB\n\nmill &lt;- obj_size(rnorm(1e6)) \n\nobj_size(list(rnorm(1e6), rnorm(1e6), rnorm(1e6)))#??\n\n24.00 MB\n\nobj_size(list(mill, mill, mill))#??\n\n368 B\n\nobj_size(tibble(a = mill, \n                b = mill,\n                c = mill))\n\n1.21 kB\n\n\nAll strings are held in a common area of memory called the common string pool. This gives rise to a lot of interesting size consequence for vectors with shared strings:\n\ns1 &lt;- c(\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"mat\")\ns2 &lt;- c(\"the\", \"the\", \"the\", \"the\")\n\nobj_size(s1)\n\n304 B\n\nobj_size(s2)\n\n136 B\n\nref(s1, character = TRUE)\n\n█ [1:0x14ba2d059b8] &lt;chr&gt; \n├─[2:0x14b98f15d48] &lt;string: \"the\"&gt; \n├─[3:0x14b9425a378] &lt;string: \"cat\"&gt; \n├─[4:0x14ba1c13c48] &lt;string: \"sat\"&gt; \n└─[5:0x14b97784880] &lt;string: \"mat\"&gt; \n\nref(s2, character = TRUE)\n\n█ [1:0x14ba5444378] &lt;chr&gt; \n├─[2:0x14b98f15d48] &lt;string: \"the\"&gt; \n├─[2:0x14b98f15d48] \n├─[2:0x14b98f15d48] \n└─[2:0x14b98f15d48] \n\nobj_size(c(1,2,3,4)) # numeric vectors don't behave in the same way\n\n80 B\n\nobj_size(c(4,4,4,4))\n\n80 B"
