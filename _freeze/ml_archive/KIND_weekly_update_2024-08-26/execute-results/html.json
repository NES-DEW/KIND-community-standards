Full details of our events and training can be found [on our Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a). \n\nWe've been working on the mentoring scheme this week, [including a new homepage](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-community-standards/mentoring.html). It's designed to put mentors and mentees in touch with each other to support short and well-defined pieces of work. Please get in touch with any suggestions or feedback, and do feel encouraged to put together a project proposal if there's some area of work you'd like more support with. \n\nHope to see you at something soon\n\nBrendan\n\n## Wins of the week\n\nWe're again celebrating some [community wins-of-the-week](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:QZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1@thread.tacv2/1724403556746?tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a&groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&parentMessageId=1724403556746&teamName=KIND%20Learning%20Network&channelName=General&createdTime=1724403556746), which have included:\n\n* I submitted my Master's dissertation!\n* Proactively prepared a whiteboard in teams ahead of a critical team meeting so that everyone could follow along and help organise priorities - this was the first time I'd used whiteboard on this scale\n* This week I managed to save an egg bound chicken\n* Used PowerBI to generate a recurring analysis pack for sharing with management leads. Now, instead of manually analysing the weekly data to generate charts to be copied into a PowerPoint pack, I only need to refresh the data source and export the updated PowerBI report as a PDF. 1-2 hrs of work reduced to seconds :)\n* Calmly dealt with numerous difficult colleagues and taken the initiative in the absence of more senior staff\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n<!-- ## Training -->\n\n<!-- There's no need to register for these drop-in training sessions.

ISBN 978-1408706114, <a href='https://search.worldcat.org/formats-editions/944210573'>Worldcat link</a>. Colin Smith, an information analyst at NHS GGC writes to recommend this book: 'A very interesting book from 2016. Not medical but given we've another potential round of 'austerity' on the way, still relevant as to how we run the economy and fund the NHS and public services.'\n\n\n\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n\n\n\n",
