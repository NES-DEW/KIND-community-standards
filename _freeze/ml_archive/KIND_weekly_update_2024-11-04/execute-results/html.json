You'll notice slightly less training on offer for the next few weeks than usual. That's to allow space for work on some new training resources (including an intermediate Power BI course) which will hopefully launch in the new year. Please do get in touch if you have suggestions for these new resources.\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ I received a clear congratulations for asking a great question at a meeting, nobody had thought about this. So chuffed!\n+ Started to unpick a previous project and learn from the mistakes, delays and reflect. My next step is to involve other stakeholders using  \"psychological safety\" model in a meeting. \n+ We have had an issue the last couple of weeks with a delay in data appearing in our data warehouse. With help from national colleagues we have finally managed to locate the issue and have it fixed.\n+ Got a short story accepted for publication in an anthology earlier this year. Copies became available this week and I still can't quite believe I am looking at my story in print. Wonderful feeling.\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c4740a77-6886-4f16-9929-6f9ab9f6d420@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Flowcharts in Mermaid</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 12:00-13:00 Thu 5th December 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Skills </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 2nd December 2024.

Not medical but given we've another potential round of 'austerity' on the way, still relevant as to how we run the economy and fund the NHS and public services.'.\n\n\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n\n\n",
