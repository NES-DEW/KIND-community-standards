I'm delighted to say that our R reading group will be back next week on Thursday 26th 3-4pm. You can find [details and the link to the reading on our the community pages](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-community-standards/rreadgr.html).\n\nThis past week has also thrown up a few technical hitches in training sessions. The most common cause of trouble comes from guests joining our training sessions without belonging to the KIND Teams channel. We love meeting new people in training, and I'm always grateful for the word of mouth transmission that helps so many of our activities reach people right across the sector. So please can I encourage you to pass on the [link to join the channel](https://forms.office.com/r/WQdd6HSCEW) to anyone who might be interested in our sessions and materials. Thanks - it'll help make everything smoother for everyone.\n\nHope to see you at something soon\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ Carried out an audit following the correction of some data, presented it at a meeting and was given the go-ahead for my suggested fixes, and implemented them! Yay!\n+ I did a Couch to 5k session this morning before work this morning. Tiring but felt good after!\n+ A teeny victory but a victory nonetheless - whole load of Committee papers collated and converted as necessary, sent for checking before issue to all; and there were no changes required!  Go me!\n+ Just made some colleagues' day by introducing them to pivot tables and charts to report their data.  Best part of my job is the sounds that emanate from learners when they're amazed.  It never gets old...\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721302592245?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Excel formatting</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09:30-10:30 Tue 1st October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721391946166?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">R from scratch (session 5)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 14:30-15:30 Tue 1st October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> R </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723033945779?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">BI for beginners (service version, session 4)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10:00-12:00 Thu 3rd October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Power BI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723472672494?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Tableau for beginners (session 3)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:30-15:30 Thu 3rd October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Tableau </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n## Events\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 30th September 2024.

The theme this week is **SQL**. SQL is one of the most widely used types of database. One consequence of that longevity is the baffling number of different products that use SQL. This session aims to introduce some of those products in use, and to demystify the terminology. \n- 1-2pm, Tue 1st October 2024. The Scottish Community of Data Analysts is a community of practice for those working with data in territorial NHS Boards. Next week, the presenter will be [Camillia Somers - PHS Survey on Statistical Publications](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a109a603c446743308bff6588820372a9%40thread.tacv2/1671457631308?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2284150c3d-baed-4515-8eee-8f13ed0d9650%22%7d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Book of the week\n\ncharacter(0). character(0). *character(0)*. </br> ISBN numeric(0), <a href='character(0)'>Worldcat</a>.</br></br> character(0).\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n",
