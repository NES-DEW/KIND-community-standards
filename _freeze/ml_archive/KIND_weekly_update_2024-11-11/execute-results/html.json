We've got a few R-themed events coming up this week, including our regular monthly R beginners club session. Hope to see you there if you're curious about R, a new R starter, or trying to build your R skills. \n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ Felt like I was plodding along this week, but looking back I've managed to get a couple of large pieces of work completed and am organised for next week so a success!\n+ Been asked to go along to a group run by a colleague, to support some work they're doing and bring a different viewpoint. Chuffed at being asked and that my opinion is valued in a non-threatening but supportive way\n+ I won an americano tournament in paddle ðŸŽŠ\n+ Finally managed to complete and submit the practical component of my GA coursework assignment.\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1725361851404?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">HTML for non-web developers</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:00-15:00 Wed 20th November 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Skills </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 18th November 2024.

A group session for R beginners to review their code, get unstuck, and pick up some tips and tricks. More experienced R programmers are absolutely welcome too, but this session is focused on those new to (or returning to) R code. All welcome, especially if you're brand new to R or are coming from our R from Scratch course. \n\n\n\n\n## Book of the week\n\n\n\ncharacter(0). character(0). *character(0)*. </br> ISBN character(0), <a href='character(0)'>Worldcat</a>.</br></br> character(0).\n\n\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n\n\n",
