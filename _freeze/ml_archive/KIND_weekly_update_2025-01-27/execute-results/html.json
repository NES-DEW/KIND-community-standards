Hope you're keeping safe.\n\nA retrospective notice of an interesting resource: the Knowledge Network produced an excellent [Sway full of resources for health information week](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/BHZrCylRdpJFHVpX?ref=Link). Highly recommended.\n\nWe've also got the first of our 2025 run of community meetup sessions happening next week. That's kindly been offered by Richard Hassett, a specialist senior prescribing support technician from NHS GGC. He writes:\n\n> I have fairly recently been gifted the task of running some R scripting to produce medication adherence visualisations for a number of secondary care consultants working in my health board. It aims to support easy identification of sub-optimal medication adherence and trigger a conversation between clinician and patient...Iâ€™d like some help to better understand what it is doing. Through a process of trial and error I can usually resolve but Iâ€™m concerned Iâ€™m messing things up in the background. Secondly, it seems rather complex and so I wonder if there is scope to simplify or automate more of it...\n\nThis should be an excellent session for R-enthusiasts to come together to support an innovative and useful project.
