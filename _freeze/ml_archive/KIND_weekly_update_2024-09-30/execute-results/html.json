We're coming to the end of the run of training sessions aimed at beginners that has been taking place over the past month or so. Those training sessions will be repeated in the future, but we'll be concentrating on the more ambitious end of our training offer during November and December this year. \n\nHope to see you at something soon\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ I passed my master's degree with distinction. \n+ Wrote a snazzy report in Rmarkdown this week. Who knows if it will end up getting used, but I learnt a lot in making it!  \n+ I supported a colleague who was going through some difficulties and gave them space to process their feelings\n+ I've managed to handle my first short-deadline piece of work for an external customer. Confidence is rising!\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721302592245?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Excel formatting</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09:30-10:30 Tue 1st October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721391946166?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">R from scratch (session 5)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 14:30-15:30 Tue 1st October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> R </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723033945779?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">BI for beginners (service version, session 4)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10:00-12:00 Thu 3rd October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Power BI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723472672494?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Tableau for beginners (session 3)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:30-15:30 Thu 3rd October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Tableau </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n## Events\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 30th September 2024.
