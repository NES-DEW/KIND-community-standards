A power-of-presenting special this week:\n\n+ Successfully took part in a meeting relating to a project I'm part of, properly spoke up, explained my points and all! Happy with myself\n+ Managed to confidently present at a Partnership Committee\n+ Glad to say that a workshop I had to facilitate this week for a difficult working group for a new project went well.\n+ Received thanks/recognition from the Big Boss in a full Directorate meeting for a partnership project that has taken a lot of time and effort. Made me feel all warm and fuzzy. \n\nWell done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c4740a77-6886-4f16-9929-6f9ab9f6d420@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Flowcharts in Mermaid</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 12:00-13:00 Thu 5th December 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Skills </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 2nd December 2024. [All welcome at the Community Meetup - our regular Monday get-together/webinar/tech demo](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723028114046?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d). Full details and joining links via the [community activities channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/Community%20meetups?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a). The theme this week is **building a brand.yml for NHS Scotland**. [brand.yml](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) is a new and concise way of styling Quarto documents. [NHS England have recently produced a template file](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/brand-guidelines/nhsr-community/), and the plan for this week's community meetup is to spend an hour working together to develop one for Scotland. All welcome, especially non-expert and new R users, because this looks like a great starter project if you're looking for a first R project with a public component. \n- 1-2pm, Tue 3rd December 2024. The Scottish Community of Data Analysts is a community of practice for those working with data in territorial NHS Boards. Next week, the presenter will be [Nora Villamil Buenrostro - Predictors of DNAs for OP Paediatrics](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a109a603c446743308bff6588820372a9%40thread.tacv2/1671457631308?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2284150c3d-baed-4515-8eee-8f13ed0d9650%22%7d).\n- Follow NES Knowledge Serviceâ€™s 12 days of Christmas on The Knowledge Network for a festive tour of resources!
