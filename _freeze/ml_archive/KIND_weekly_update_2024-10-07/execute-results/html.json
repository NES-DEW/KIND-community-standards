I'm away for the second half of October, which will necessitate a brief pause for our training and community events. We'll be back in late October, and you can expect the next regular email update in early November. Hope to see you at something then.\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ I owned a work mistake and the world did not explode\n+ Using a chi-square test of independence on a dataset (when I wasn't asked to) and the requestor actually understanding and really liking the outputs\n+ I pushed against my introvert preference and held a training session to help staff understand the relationship between DATIX incidents, the boards risk strategy and H&S actions\n+ I have managed to build a small shiny app. Although I have a long way to go. I am feeling really proud\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721302655381?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Excel formulas</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09:30-10:30 Tue 8th October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721391946166?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">R from scratch (session 6)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 14:30-15:30 Tue 8th October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> R </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723472672494?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Tableau for beginners (session 4)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:00-15:00 Thu 10th October 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Tableau </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 7th October 2024.

Full details and joining links via the [community meetup channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/Community%20meetups?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a). The theme this week is **working with user requests**. We'll be looking at some examples of good ideas from the community about how to work more easily and effectively with user requests. \n\n\n\n## Book of the week\n\n\nGerd Gigerenzer. 2002. *Reckoning with Risk: Learning to Live with Uncertainty*. </br> ISBN 978-0713995122, <a href='https://search.worldcat.org/formats-editions/49690492'>Worldcat</a>.</br></br> How do you communicate risks? For many of us who work with knowledge, information, and data, the natural way of doing that is by talking about probabilities. This book, which is a lively and provoking introduction to the [frequency format hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_format_hypothesis) might give us cause for pause: it turns out that frequencies serve as much stronger communicators of risk than probabilities. So if you want to communicate a risk, there's a good reason to prefer saying *8 out of 10 people* rather than *80% of people*..\n\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n\n",
