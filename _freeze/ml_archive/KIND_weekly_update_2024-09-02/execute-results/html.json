We have a back-to-school feel to the coming week, with the first sessions of our Excel and R beginners courses. These will be joined over the next fortnight by Power BI and Tableau beginner courses - early details can be found [on the training pages](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/schedule.html). We'll also have the first of our autumn series of community meetups.\n\nHope to see you at something soon - and save the 11th December for the KIND unconference\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ Passed my Uni course on an Introduction to Programming in R\n+ Made an action plan to boost my skillset and CV over the next three months to become more \"marketable\" to the jobs and sectors I'm interested in.\n+ This week I stood up for myself and called out a colleague who had made inappropriate jokes about my size. Proud of myself for not hiding away from the confrontation! ðŸ’ª\n+ I've been working on speaking confidently whilst presenting data (I really struggle with this). Yesterday I managed to do a great presentation and answer questions confidently. Very proud!\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721291150537?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Excel first steps</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09:30-10:30 Tue 3rd September 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721391946166?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">R from scratch (session 1)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 14:30-15:30 Tue 3rd September 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> R </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n(the Excel session is also our 400th training session, so party hats etc at the ready)\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 2nd September 2024.

Martin. 2008. *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship*. </br> ISBN 9780136083238, <a href='https://search.worldcat.org/title/223933035'>Worldcat</a>.</br></br> This week's book of the week was suggested by Zena Trendell, a Programme Manager at NHS Lothian. She writes: 'I recently read *The Clean Code* by Robert Cecil Martin. I'm not a coder but thought it was very good. The book is about professionalism for developers (similar to accountants etc.) and give you some tools to help prevent feeling under pressure re: timescales. It's not a recent book yet very relevant to some incidents that have happened lately.'.\n\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n\n",
