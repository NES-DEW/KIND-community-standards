We have a back-to-school feel to the coming week, with the first sessions of our Excel and R beginners courses. These will be joined over the next fortnight by Power BI and Tableau beginner courses - early details can be found [on the training pages](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/schedule.html). We'll also have the first of our autumn series of community meetups.\n\nHope to see you at something soon - and save the 11th December for the KIND unconference\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ Passed my Uni course on an Introduction to Programming in R\n+ Made an action plan to boost my skillset and CV over the next three months to become more \"marketable\" to the jobs and sectors I'm interested in.\n+ This week I stood up for myself and called out a colleague who had made inappropriate jokes about my size. Proud of myself for not hiding away from the confrontation! ðŸ’ª\n+ I've been working on speaking confidently whilst presenting data (I really struggle with this). Yesterday I managed to do a great presentation and answer questions confidently. Very proud!\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c4740a77-6886-4f16-9929-6f9ab9f6d420@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Flowcharts in Mermaid</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 12:00-13:00 Thu 5th December 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Skills </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n\n(the Excel session is also our 400th training session, so party hats etc at the ready)\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 2nd December 2024.
