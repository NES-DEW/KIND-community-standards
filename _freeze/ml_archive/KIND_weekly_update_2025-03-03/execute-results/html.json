Power Automate gives you low-code ways of creating automated processes. Common uses might be:\n\n+ to get a Teams message every time a colleague adds something to a shared document\n+ to copy data from one spreadsheet to another\n+ to manage mailing lists (including this one)\n\nWe'll have a week of Power Automate-themed events on the network during the first week of April (**31st March to 4th April 2025**). That'll include a range of training sessions at all levels, opportunities for 1:1 and group project support, and presentations from users who are putting Power Automate to work in health and social care. \n\nHope to see you then - and please get in touch if there are Power Automate topics you'd be especially keen to hear about.\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:\n\n+ Helped a colleague with a ggplot they were having issues with, and turns out I needed very similar code a day later so that was a double win!\n+ Just finalised workshop presentation that I am delivering at 1pm-4.30pm this afternoon!\n+ Helped out a colleague at another Health Board with a project. My HB will see no benefit of this but hopefully NHS Scotland will overall!\n+ I didn't think of this as a win at all until someone else validated it as one (why am I like this?!)  Worked with my consultant to come up with an electronic version of a process rather than it being paper-based.  The new way saves money and the environment by not printing multiple pages every time, it saves time and is more efficient for us, and it, hopefully, means that patients could be seen quicker.\n\nWell done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n\nClick the link to book yourself into the session.\n\n\n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/3557297e-623f-46a2-918f-81ed82e97991@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Pivot tables and pivot charts</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:00-14:30 Wed 19th March 2025 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶: <b>intermediate-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ## Events -->\n\n<!-- A pair of community meetup sessions for your enjoyment this week.
