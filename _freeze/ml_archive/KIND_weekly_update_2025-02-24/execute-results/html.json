I'm starting to schedule the next batch of training dates, so here are some save-the-dates for your calendar:\n\n+ Excel for beginners, six weekly sessions running Wednesdays 1-2pm from April 23rd - May 28th\n+ Intermediate Excel, five weekly sessions running Tuesdays 10-11.30am from April 22nd - May 20th\n+ Power BI for beginners, four weekly sessions running Thursdays 1-2.30pm from April 24th - May 15th\n\nYou can expect to see a proper announcement with booking links etc for those sessions over the next week or so on the KIND network Teams channel.\n\nHope to see you at something soon.\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community:\n\n+ Finally managed to concentrate on a task I've had on my list since August\n+ Was asked to support an extensive audit of Programme Assurance documentation - painstaking but rewarding.  And what was once a workstream that gave me the fear - I actually really enjoyed it\n+ I had the fun task of making training videos this week, I used the 'video project' tool within clipchamp on MS Stream and it was surprisingly painless. The trainers were happy with them!\n+ I was able to build an SSRS report with a drill through capability and also with KPI Score Cards\n\nWell done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n\nClick the link to book yourself into the session.\n\n\n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/3557297e-623f-46a2-918f-81ed82e97991@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Pivot tables and pivot charts</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:00-14:30 Wed 19th March 2025 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶: <b>intermediate-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ## Events -->\n\n<!-- A pair of community meetup sessions for your enjoyment this week.
