We're starting our new Tableau for Beginner's course next week. That uses [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/) so should be available to all. Hope to see you there [13.00-15.00 this coming Thursday](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723472672494?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d).\n\nA reminder that we'll be scheduling training sessions for November and December next week. Please [get in touch](mailto:brendan.clarke2@nhs.scot) ASAP if you'd like some training for your team. We can potentially offer [any of our multi-session courses](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/36791) or [any of our one-off sessions](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/schedule.html#training-menu) to you and your team free of charge. All that we ask is that you can commit to having 15-20 staff attend the sessions, and that you can take care of any admin and infrastructure requirements such as circulating invites, installing software etc.\n\nHope to see you at something soon\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ I succeeded in using INDEX and MATCH to help a colleague onboard data from a separate spreadsheet into the exact rows required. She was so chuffed.  ðŸ˜ƒ Then replaced the formulas with values using paste special.\n+ Volunteered to provide a brief summary of work being done by myself and fellow PHIT on developing a Lothian child poverty indicators dashboard at this weeks' SCODAS meeting. Off the back of that there appears to be further interest for us to present at a future SCODAS session where we present the dashboard\n+ I ran my first (and only!) half-marathon last Sunday, completing the Great North Run - and, thanks to supporters, raising funds for Parkinson's UK. Very chuffed with myself!\n+ Joined the R from Scratch session this week after not using R for almost a year and found that I actually remembered quite a lot of the content that was being taught.  Win win for me and I didn't panic too much as I thought that I had forgotten everything!\n\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721302443391?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Tidy data in Excel</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09:30-10:30 Tue 17th September 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excel </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1721391946166?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">R from scratch (session 3)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 14:30-15:30 Tue 17th September 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> R </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723033945779?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">BI for beginners (service version, session 2)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10:00-12:00 Thu 19th September 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Power BI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723472672494?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d\">Tableau for beginners (session 1)</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 13:00-15:00 Thu 19th September 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Tableau </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 16th September 2024.
