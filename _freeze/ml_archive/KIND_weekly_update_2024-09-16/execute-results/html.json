We're starting our new Tableau for Beginner's course next week. That uses [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/) so should be available to all. Hope to see you there [13.00-15.00 this coming Thursday](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1723472672494?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d).\n\nA reminder that we'll be scheduling training sessions for November and December next week. Please [get in touch](mailto:brendan.clarke2@nhs.scot) ASAP if you'd like some training for your team. We can potentially offer [any of our multi-session courses](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/36791) or [any of our one-off sessions](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/schedule.html#training-menu) to you and your team free of charge. All that we ask is that you can commit to having 15-20 staff attend the sessions, and that you can take care of any admin and infrastructure requirements such as circulating invites, installing software etc.\n\nHope to see you at something soon\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ I succeeded in using INDEX and MATCH to help a colleague onboard data from a separate spreadsheet into the exact rows required. She was so chuffed.  ðŸ˜ƒ Then replaced the formulas with values using paste special.\n+ Volunteered to provide a brief summary of work being done by myself and fellow PHIT on developing a Lothian child poverty indicators dashboard at this weeks' SCODAS meeting. Off the back of that there appears to be further interest for us to present at a future SCODAS session where we present the dashboard\n+ I ran my first (and only!) half-marathon last Sunday, completing the Great North Run - and, thanks to supporters, raising funds for Parkinson's UK. Very chuffed with myself!\n+ Joined the R from Scratch session this week after not using R for almost a year and found that I actually remembered quite a lot of the content that was being taught.  Win win for me and I didn't panic too much as I thought that I had forgotten everything!\n\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c4740a77-6886-4f16-9929-6f9ab9f6d420@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Flowcharts in Mermaid</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 12:00-13:00 Thu 5th December 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Skills </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n\n\n- 3-4pm, Mon 2nd December 2024.

The theme this week is **joins** again, with the third and final sessions on the topic. This session will concentrate on more advanced techniques - rolling joins, non-equi joins etc. As usual, we'll do a bit of introduction and chat, and then show how these can be implemented in a range of platforms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Book of the week\n\n\n\n\nMervyn King. 2016. *The End of Alchemy: Money, Banking and the Future of the Global Economy*. </br> ISBN 978-1408706114, <a href='https://search.worldcat.org/formats-editions/944210573'>Worldcat</a>.</br></br> Colin Smith, an information analyst at NHS GGC writes to recommend this book: 'A very interesting book from 2016. Not medical but given we've another potential round of 'austerity' on the way, still relevant as to how we run the economy and fund the NHS and public services.'.\n\n\n\n\n[Unsubscribe from these emails](https://forms.office.com/r/t97cZDiw7y)\n\n\n\n\n\n",
