That'll be (almost) a week dedicated to sessions about core data skills and knowledge. More information on that over the coming weeks.\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Power Automate week plan\n\nWe're running a network-wide [Microsoft Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/power-platform/products/power-automate) week between 31st March and 4th April.
