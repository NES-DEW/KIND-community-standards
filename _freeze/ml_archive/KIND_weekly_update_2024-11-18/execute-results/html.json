We're starting to lead up to our Unconference event this week. The Unconference is a one day conference led by community members to discuss topics of interest, share presentations about great work, and to make sure the KIND network keeps providing relevant and useful training during 2025. Key info:\n\n- Wednesday 11th December, 9.30 to 4ish\n- free to access, with registration details coming next week\n- non-recorded live sessions on Teams\n\nFull details of the programme, and routes for contribution, can be found [on the Unconference Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A841c83b753324873866f54b10b5ce380%40thread.tacv2/KIND%20Unconference%202024?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a).\n\nBrendan\n\n---\n\n## Wins of The Week\nIn the spirit of [#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable), we do a weekly wins of the week thread to celebrate the professional (and personal) achievements of the community. A random selection from last week:\n\n+ Made good progress with a project I'm dying to see the back of.\n+ After nearly 3 years in a seconded post, I interviewed yesterday and my post is now permanent!\n+ Finding beauty in the wonderous early morning sunrises and the big sky colours\n+ Work: Successfully got a first draft output for the project I'm the analyst on and the boss liked it! Non-work: Successfully got through the worst uni coursework without going mad\n\nWell done all, and looking forward to [hearing your wins of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) in future.\n\n---\n\n## Training sessions\n  \n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Session </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Level </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;max-width: 18em; \"> <a href=\"https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c4740a77-6886-4f16-9929-6f9ab9f6d420@10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a\">Flowcharts in Mermaid</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 12:00-13:00 Thu 5th December 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Skills </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ðŸŒ¶ :<b>beginner-level</b> </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n\n\n\n## Events\n\n\n\n- Our [R reading group session is Thursday 21st November 3-4pm](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ab03b2fd777e440eaa255ba67569762b5%40thread.tacv2/1716881796537?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2210efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225d92fd7e-56b9-4892-ab77-84ad75c260a0%22%7d).
