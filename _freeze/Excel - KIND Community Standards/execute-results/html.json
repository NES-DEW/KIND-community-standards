This document contains a simple check-list to avoid the most serious problems found in Excel files in health and care. The aim is to be:\n\n- universal, to provide effective guidance across health, social care, and housing\n- simple and achievable, to keep to the most important guidance only\n- realistic and grounded in health, social care, and housing practices\n\nThis is version 1, and this document will be fully reviewed in January 2025 by the KIND network community.\n\n## Basic standard for Excel workbooks\n\n+ Make your data tidy\n  + One value per cell\n  + One observation per row\n  + One variable per column\n+ Avoid repetition\n  + consider restructuring into several tables to avoid repeating data\n+ Use tables to contain data wherever possible\n+ Use meaningful sheet, table, and column names (not `Sheet 1`, `Sheet 2`...)\n+ Use number formatting as appropriate\n    + Dates and percentages are especially important to format correctly\n    + Text format for CHI numbers, rather than the initial '\n+ Avoid using colour-based formatting which can easily breach accessibility guidance\n  + If conditional format is required, prefer using more accessible formats, such as shape icons sets\n\n## Enhanced standard for Excel workbooks\nFollow the basic standards above, plus:\n\n+ Consider using data validation to make data consistent, especially if you don't really want free text\n+ Add a documentation / readme worksheet. You might include:\n    + a description of the data\n    + information about ownership/origin/dates/data sources\n    + a key explaining abbreviations\n    + explanation of any complex formulas \n    + advice about correct and consistent method of naming different versions of the workbook\n+ Consider using lambda formulas to avoid repetition of complex formulas\n+ Prefer structured referencing and naming to the use of complex A1 referencing\n+ Consider loading data using Power Query, especially if the workbook is designed to be updated\n\n\n\n",
