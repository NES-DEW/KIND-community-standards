I find some of the sessions a bit rushed but I think that might be more about my ability and comprehension.\n- Really interesting first session. I've done some basic R training last year but have not had time to really get stuck into it properly and use it but this was a gentle reminder session that I've not forgotten everything that I was taught. Phew! Now I need to make time to start using it and transferring all out current processing of data from SPSS to R\n- I wasn't able to join for the full session but the worked example of starting to compare two datasets (simple tables from Excel) was really useful to me to observe and make notes on to try for myself. I also really appreciated that when things strayed from being 'beginner', Brendan you skillfully redirected so that we could keep things at the beginners level we are sometimes short of, because there a re a LOT of very clever and skilled people in our organisation - but like driving, everyone has to learn first. \n  \n:::  ",
