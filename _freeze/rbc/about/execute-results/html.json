I find some of the sessions a bit rushed but I think that might be more about my ability and comprehension.\n- As an occasional R user this was the perfect way to get a refresher and learn joins and file comparisons which are very relevant for my job. Also, great to have a brief personal introduction at the beginning to make it easier to collaborate beyond the session if needed..\n  \n:::  ",
