I also really appreciated that when things strayed from being 'beginner', Brendan you skillfully redirected so that we could keep things at the beginners level we are sometimes short of, because there a re a LOT of very clever and skilled people in our organisation - but like driving, everyone has to learn first. \n- The session was really helpful and helped point me in the right direction for a project I am working on.\n  \n:::  ",
