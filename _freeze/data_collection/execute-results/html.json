If there is any doubt, you should contact your Information Governance and/or Caldicott teams before beginning collection.\n:::\n\nNote that this guide does not deal with data collection for research purposes, which is governed by different legislative and ethical standards. There can be some difficulty in deciding whether a piece of data collection would count as research, and so you might find the [HRA *Is my study research?* tool](https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/) helpful.\n\n-   only collect data you are going to use\n-   collect the absolute minimum information you can. This is both good\n    practice, and a [legal\n    obligation](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/the-principles/data-minimisation/)\n-   make sure that your information has not already been collected\n-   different types of information (especially [personal\n    data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-information-what-is-it/what-is-personal-information-a-guide/))\n    will require different standards. This can be complex, so please\n    make contact with your colleagues in Information Governance early in\n    the process\n\n## Enhanced standard for data collection\n\n-   do you need to make sure that data will be collected consistently?\n    This is especially important if data collection will be lengthy, or\n    large-scale. Consider writing an SOP for data collection\n\n\n## Why think about data collection?\n\n> \"We are often asked to collect, but many of us lack official training\n> and support for the kinds of complex questions thrown up by data\n> collection. Using data and collecting data are really different\"\n(anonymous KIND member)\n\n## Why collect data?\n\nSome example purposes, drawn from a small-scale survey of 40 analysts\nfrom NHS boards performed during 2023: \n\n+ for clinical audit / quality\nimprovement\n+ for statutory data collection / official and national statistics \n+ establishing new services / requirements \n+ user research \n+ organisational consultation \n+ for performance and evaluation purposes\n\n\n## Tools used for data collection\n\nIn a 2023 small-scale survey of 40 analysts, the main tools identified\nwere as follows:\n\n| Tool                                                | n   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Excel                                               | 32  |\n| Microsoft Forms                                     | 16  |\n| Other survey tools (e.g. Surveymonkey, SmartSurvey) | 15  |\n| RedCap                                              | 2   |\n(note that respondents were able to identify >1 tool used)\n\nThat simplicity of tools used conceals enormous complexity. A sample of factors identified as influencing tool choice were as follows:\n\n+ availability / ubiquity amongst those collecting\n+ flexibility / integration\n+ audit trail\n+ downstream ETL \n+ commissioning and training requirements\n+ ease of use / skills available\n+ IG / robustness / confidentiality \n+ cost\n+ stakeholder mandate\n+ technical features (e.g., limited response types)\n+ speed of build\n+ institutional approval and support\n\nMany staff have restrictions on the tools available. For example, looking at Microsoft Forms, a wide variety of different possibilities are found. A survey of 64 members of the KIND network during July 2024 gained responses from 23 organisations and NHS boards.\n\n<!-- ### Top five boards and orgs -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Q: Can you use Forms?\n\n\n\n\n\nTable: Responses to the question 'Can you use Forms?'\n\n|response                                              |  n|\n|:-----------------------------------------------------|--:|\n|Yes - for anything                                    | 17|\n|Yes - but not for personally-identifiable information | 36|\n|No                                                    |  2|\n|Other                                                 |  9|\n",
