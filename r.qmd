Please note this is a work-in-progress draft, due for completion end-June 2024

## Basic standard

* Use projects
* Collect packages at head of script
+ Keep package loading minimal (nothing "just in case")
+ Use descriptive variable names
+ No repeated code - use functions where a specific bit of code needs to be used multiple times. 
+ Properly structured sections (using hyperlinks ># Section 1 ----)
+ Include authorship, contact details, and brief documentation of the purpose of the script
+ Any variables that need changing to be dealt with in a systematic manner - i.e. no need to look through the script for things that need changing for the specific use case.
+ Variables to change could be listed at the top of the script, or in an input file etc etc
    + Consider a settings file if there are lots of these
+ Think about units. An individual script should run as one - ie workflow should not be run first half of the script, do something else, run second half of the script - in this case they should be two separate scripts. 

## Enhanced standard

+ Explicit reference to any formal style conventions
+ Use version control 
+ For ambitious projects, consider {renv} (which will capture R and package versions). For smaller projects, list packages at top of script, along with installation instructions for any non CRAN / no longer on CRAN packages
+ For more onerous scripts, identify memory and CPU requirements listed at start
+ consider using templates for presentations/reports/dashboards

## Group considerations
+ Have a house code style, possibly implemented using styler. Code styling for readability is important, and no-one agrees, so you'll need to lead.
