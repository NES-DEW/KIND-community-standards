## Theme discussions

We'll be running short discussion sessions on the following topics:

* "*some sort of lessons learned from setting up new tech*" - what have we learned about new tech, what do we wish we'd known beforehand, and what information should we (have) capture(d)

* "*we have access to an Aston Martin and we are using it for the school run*" - making the case for what we already have, making the case for exploiting available capabilities, realising benefits, and overcoming resistance to change
 
* "*high demand for support from the users, far more than I expected*" - knowledge sharing, dealing with support and training needs, keeping yourself/everyone else current, and trying to think sensibly about different needs and different ways of supporting those needs

* "*proceeding until apprehended*" - some people seek permission, others forgiveness. Balancing getting things done with professional obligations in a climate of murky guidance

* "*you said X first, and that suits, so we'll stick with X*" - doing things fast vs doing them right, and communicating the difference to colleagues/stakeholders etc
 
* "*'we weren't trained' and 'we're not interested.'* " skills mapping, writing JDs to suit actual needs, and developing some understanding of how skills and careers can be better fitted together
 
* "*if it doesn't help your prospects then what's the point of it*" - professional registration as somewhere between pointless money-pit and vital route to becoming a proper career?
