## A big laugh

(this remains a useful and thoughtful point, and it's a bit of mystery why Donald Rumsfeld was so widely mocked for making it)

## A big point
+ this entire session presumes that you've got a good reason to put together some training
+ understanding training needs is hard
    + individual and group needs often don't align
    + most of us don't go round knowing we have well-formed training needs
    + time is short and demands are many
    + most of us don't have any formal expertise in assessing training needs
    + institutional training mechanisms usually don't reach individual teams 

# Intro

## Training isn't status-y

+ informal training is common in this sector
+ but hard, thankless, time-consuming etc
    + who had training delivery in their appraisal?
+ this session = quick tips and dirty tricks for leading sessions
+ this session ≠ how to be a proper educator, TED talker, or other species of charismatic
    + e.g. we won't talk about styles of learning or anything like that

## A worry about individualised training
+ most of this assumes that training is individual
+ but the objective of most training is team performance
+ there's a complicated relationship between those things
+ the individualised model can reward training activities that don't help team performance
    + PDPs aren't easy to connect to service needs

# General considerations

## General considerations
+ presentations are about optimizing over competing demands
    + that's hard
    + we'll start with some easy general rules
    + and move on to some ways of balancing those demands
    
## General rules
+ as simple as possible - because **asymmetry**
+ show, don't tell - because **hierarchy**
+ steal and share - because **instability**


## The asymmetry of presenting

::::

:::: {.column width="70%"}
+ by the time you get asked to present, you're an expert
    + experts worry about completely different things from beginners
+ experts make bad assumptions about what an average person knows
    + ← AKA the *[curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)*
+ you're also (probably) going to spend more time preparing than presenting
    + beware pedantry, minor details, and fine print

::::

## The hierarchy
+ like it or not, some of what you say will be more important than other parts
+ like it or not, it's your job to decide what's most important
+ like it or not, if everything is important then nothing is

## The instability of facts

![Truth survival in original articles on hepatitis and cirrhosis (Poynard et al 2002)](images/01_half_life.png){height="400"}


## The instability of facts
+ refreshing statistics courses every x years
+ refreshing philosophy courses every y years
+ refreshing bioscience courses every z years
+ **polling** for values of x, y, and z
  + x = 5-10
  + y = 5-7
  + z = 2-3 
+ annual refresh for KIND materials

## The instability of facts
+ things change
+ making sure training materials reflect change is hard
+ but training materials are almost always shareable...
    + your session on Excel might not be very different from someone else's session on Excel
    + bridge materials plus borrowed material might be a better combo than something written from scratch
    
## General rules
+ as simple as possible - because **asymmetry**
+ show, don't tell - because **hierarchy**
+ steal and share - because **instability**
. . .
+ adapt your plans to your circumstances...

# n questions

## Some questions to help you make training decisions
+ 3 groups of questions
    + who are you training?
    + what is the training like?
    + what should happen?
    
## Population
+ supply or demand?
+ formal or informal?
+ homogeneous or heterogeneous population?
+ 1:1 or group?
+ durable or fragile?

## Intervention
+ specific or general?
+ regular or occasional/one-off?
+ sync or async?
+ didactic or social?

## Intervention
```{r}

tibble::tibble(x = c(4, -4, -2, 2, -2, 2), 
              y = c(-4, 4, -2, 2, 2, -2), 
              name = c("", "", "Informal help", "Write a proper course", "Hints page / FAQ", "Outsourced training")) |>
  quadgo("General", "Occasional", "General to specific, and occasional to regular")

```

## Intervention
```{r}

tibble::tibble(x = c(4, -4, -2, 2, -2, 2), 
              y = c(-4, 4, -2, 2, 2, -2), 
              name = c("", "", "Live training sessions (talky)", "Teams channel and clinic times", "Manual or SOP", "Live training sessions (practical)")) |>
  quadgo("Synchronous", "Didactic", "Synchronous to asynchronous, and didactic to social")

```


## Outcomes
+ bridge or foundations?
+ knowledge or skills?
+ practice/problem-based or theoretical?
+ individual or group?


# Actual strategies

## Four general training needs
+ have a clear, relevant, specific, idea
+ be the help on hand
+ try to bridge between work and training
+ provide real relevant practice tasks

## Borrow-and-gloss
### helps with instability

+ loads of great open-access training resources exist
+ consider borrowing and adapting, rather than writing from scratch
    + lots of the commercial training providers do this. Definitely better value to DIY

## Bridge materials
### helps with hiearchy and instability

+ everyone's work is different
+ consider writing **bridge materials** = ways of connecting generic resources with particular contents
    + e.g. replacing table names to match your SQL
    + e.g. changing exercises to use more relevant data
    + e.g. swapping sales-led applications for analysis-led ones

## Post-it® planning
### helps with asymmetry and hiearchy

::::

:::: {.column width="70%"}
+ your overall topic should be neatly describable on a Post-it®
+ your talk should break down into a small number of distinct sections
    + each section should, likewise, be Post-it®-able
          + each subsection etc etc
+ the trick is to get the lower level descriptions to align with the higher, all the way up
::::

## Bottom-up planning
### helps when you don't know where to start

+ all training is just scaled-up 1:1 helping
+ so if you're stuck, start by helping someone
+ work through with a volunteer and help them 1:1
+ take notes - what are you doing, who are you helping, what can they do
+ repeat, adding and taking away

## The Saint-Exupéry principle

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
