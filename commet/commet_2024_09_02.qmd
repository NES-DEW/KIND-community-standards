## How to think about joins?

A join is a way of merging two datasets. Let's demonstrate with some simple data:

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
x <- tibble(
  name = c("Steve", "Emma", "Arti"),
  tool = c("R", "Excel", "Excel"),
  training_sessions = c(4,3,7)
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
x |>
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
y <- tibble(
  name = c("Abena", "Yuika", "Arti"),
  tool = c("R", "Excel", "Power BI"),
  training_sessions = c(3,5,3)
)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
y |>
  knitr::kable()
```

## Binding

The simplest join we could do is to bind the rows from one set onto another:

```{r}
x |>
  bind_rows(y) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

That just brings all the rows from `y` onto the end of `x`. We could also have just bound the columns together:

```{r}
x |>
  bind_cols(y) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Doing this in R, we end up with something quite messy: we've gained some new columns (with odd names), and lots of blank values. The reason for this is that Arti has a row in each dataset. Anyone without corresponding rows gets filling in with blanks.

We could do something very similar by hand in Excel. It's worth noting the `VSTACK` function, which allows you to bring one table into another in Excel. PowerQuery has some great tools for binding data. `Append Queries` allows you to perform row-binding:

![Select datasets to bind together](images/clipboard-3653621168.png)

![New table containing all rows from the original](images/clipboard-1970651010.png)

However we bind, the main distinction remains the same. When you bind, the values in your data are irrelevant. Column names will matter - e.g. row binding works when you have identically named columns. But the values themselves don't matter at all.

## Joins proper

Unlike binding, though, a join will pay attention to the values found in our data. For example, we could do a left-join:

![A left-join](images/left.png)

This would retain any data from our x dataset, but also bring in any matching data from y.So let's now left-join `y` onto x using the `name` column:

```{r}
x |>
  left_join(y, by = "name") |>
  knitr::kable()
```

We'd get entirely different results if we joined on the `tool` column:

```{r}
x |>
  left_join(y, by = "tool") |>
  knitr::kable()
```

We could do something similar, again using the name column, to add in some dis-similar data from another source:

```{r}
z <- tibble(
  name = c("Abena", "Yuika", "Arti", "Steve", "Emma", "Bruce"),
  score = c(90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 33)
)

x |>
  left_join(z, by = "name") |>
  knitr::kable()
```


There are several ways of doing this from R. If you're not a dplyr fan, you could use base-R's `merge` to do a left join:

```{r}
merge(x, y, by = "name") |>
  knitr::kable()
```

You should see that only the values from `y`'s score column that have a corresponding name in `x` get populated, and everything else gets filled with NAs. Here's a [nice introduction to the different kinds of join you can do in dplyr](https://lindsaydbrin.github.io/CREATE_R_Workshop/Lesson_-_dplyr_join.html).

Again, we can do something similar in PowerQuery - note that joins are called `Merges`

## Anti-join

An anti-join takes a dataset, and removes any matching values from the second dataset:

![An anti-join](images/anti.png)

```{r}
x |>
  anti_join(y, by = "name") |>
  knitr::kable()
```

## Final thoughts

-   some nice discussion about using `dplyr::semi_join` to find similar rows of data without actually binding columns
-   using the [pointblank](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/) package for data validation
