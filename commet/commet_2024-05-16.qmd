## Poll
+ who knows their job description by heart, or has referred to it this year?
+ who keeps a work diary?
+ who has a PDP plan?

## Background
+ It's Agenda for Change (AfC) appraisal time for many NHS staff
+ but this session is not specific to AfC appraisals

## The objective
-   KIND staff have some of the slowest promotion trajectories of all staff across health and care
-   [Our Time to Shine](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/69331/)

## Messy roles
```{r}
titles <- readr::read_csv("src/kind_titles.csv") |>
  dplyr::select(!document) 
```

+ `r sum(titles$job_n)` total titles analysed

. . .

```{r}
titles |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(job_n)) |>
  dplyr::mutate(ratio = scales::percent(job_n / sum(job_n), 0.1)) |>
  dplyr::slice(1:6) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

## Messy roles

-   no standard terminology
    - "senior officer" from AfC band 3 - band 8
-   too many titles (e.g. 400+ KIND-ish job titles compared to c.85 nursing roles)
    - biggest is about 9% of the KIND network (information analyst)
- massively higher qualifications found in KIND roles compared to many other careers

## DDaT

-   there's some interesting policy work going on to rationalise careers and titles
- but this is a good way from implementation

## Claiming credit

+ entirely informally and **without an evidence-base**: I think many of us are not very good at claiming credit for the work we do
    + something about humility and modesty in the analytic temperament?
    + Dunning-Kruger?
    + social conditioning?
    + introversion?
    + niche skills in work environment?
+ whatever the cause, (hunch) I think we under-rate our own expertise

## Tips

- diary / log
    - time and task
    - I basically OneNote a load of rubbishy bits, and make no effort to sort them until needed
- look at your JD
- look at your [KSF dimensions](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/60953)
- look at [wider skills frameworks](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/skills-framework/)
- "I did x in y, which means z in ..."
- "I need to x, which means I need y..."

## Open goals
- excessively manual processes
  - saved you time? Saved us money!
- compliance
- impact and change
- informal training and support
- management-like activity

## SMART
+ Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound
+ conceptually, a horrible mess
+ but dead useful for translating vague wants and needs into something more directed

<!-- Specific is 5 w (what, why, who, where, which) // achievable is degrees // relevant is the urgent-important matrix -->
## Share

+ please share one achievement - one thing you did last year
+ ask your group to help you formulate it - how can I sell this nicely?

## Well-formed learning needs?
