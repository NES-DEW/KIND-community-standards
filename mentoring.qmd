We run an informal budding scheme, designed to put members of the network in 1:1 contact with each other to provide mutual support, an opportunity to discuss topics of mututal interest, and to help people develop their professional networks. It's entirely informal and operates entirely by mutual consent, so participants are free to leave at any time. We think the benefits are reciprocal, with both parties gaining from the work.

If you're interested in being partnered at random with a network member, please [complete the form](https://forms.office.com/e/CnBEj5yCrk). It's important to stress that a buddy isn't there to do your work for you, provide intensive help or free consultancy, or anything like that. This scheme exists to put people in touch who have similar interests in KIND-ish stuff who'd be interested in chatting and developing an informal peer relationship.

## What might I do instead?
If buddying isn't for you, consider:

+ asking a question [on the KIND teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a)
+ completing one of our [training courses](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/36791) on a topic, particularly if you're struggling to put your request into specific language
+ presenting your query/issue in one of the open [KIND community meetup sessions](kind_cms.qmd)
