## Draft guidance

This is currently draft guidance, may therefore contain errors and omissions, and is liable to change

:::


We run an informal mentoring scheme. It's designed to support professional development, by support a project over about 8 weeks. We provide support and training for mentors to help build their mentoring skills during mentoring. The scheme operates entirely by mutual consent, so participants are free to leave at any time.

## Key documents

+ [new mentoring request form](https://forms.office.com/e/AUCcHB4ySj) - use this to propose a new project

+ [contract form](https://forms.office.com/e/ik4fpth04B) - use this to agree a new mentoring relationship (see [a sample contract](src/KIND_mentoring_sample_contract.pdf))
+ [withdrawal form](https://forms.office.com/e/9mDyGFVzB1) - use this to end a mentoring relationship

## What makes a good mentoring project?

+ successful projects are generally short and simple
  + short meaning they can generally be finished off during the 8 week mentoring scheme
  + simple meaning they don't depend on a lot of new infrastructure, require organisational change, or need an mentor to gain an unrealistic range of new skills
+ successful project proposals should therefore be short and precise
  + what are you trying to do?
  + how are you trying to do it?
  + which barrier(s) do you have in place?
  + what do you need a mentor to do?
+ successful projects aren't about cheerleading
  + we'd expect mentors to provide largely technical advice: "have you considered using x"
  + we do not expect mentors to provide detailed technical training
  + we specifically preclude mentors giving detailed technical advice regarding systems. Mentors are not consultants.

## What might I do instead?
If your project doesn't fit this scheme, consider:

+ asking a question [on the KIND teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a)
+ completing one of our [training courses](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/36791) on a topic, particularly if you're struggling to put your request into specific language
+ presenting your query/issue in one of the open [KIND community meetup sessions](kind_cms.qmd)
