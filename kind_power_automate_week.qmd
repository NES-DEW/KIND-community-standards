## Power Automate week plan

We're running a network-wide [Microsoft Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/power-platform/products/power-automate) week between 31st March and 4th April. Thatâ€™ll include a range of training sessions at all levels, opportunities for 1:1 and group project support, and presentations from users who are putting Power Automate to work in health and social care.

## Why Power Automate?

Power Automate gives you low-code ways of creating automated processes. Common uses might be:

+ to get a Teams message every time a colleague adds something to a shared document
+	to copy data from one spreadsheet to another
+	to manage mailing lists (including the KIND mailing list)

### Training sessions
