We're running a network-wide themed week on troubleshooting between 30th June and the 4th July 2025. Thatâ€™ll include a range of training sessions at all levels, opportunities for 1:1 and group support, and presentations from users about how they approach problem-solving. All welcome - we aim to run sessions at all levels of expertise, so please feel encouraged to come along.
